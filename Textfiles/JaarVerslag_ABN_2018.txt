Strategy and performance
Economic environment
The economic environment remained relatively favourable
in 2018. The key countries in which ABN AMRO operates
– Belgium, France, Germany, the United States and the
Netherlands – all experienced continued growth. Once again,
ABN AMRO’s home market outperformed its European
counterparts as the Dutch economy expanded by 2.5%.
Continued broad-based growth
The increase in activity in the Netherlands was broadbased, with household consumption, government
spending, investments and exports all contributing to
growth. Consumption advanced on the back of a positive
labour market and developments in the housing market.
The number of jobs rose, while unemployment fell to
a historic low. Although the government decided to
increase spending, supply constraints meant it was
unable to meet all its intended expenditure commitments.
Businesses experienced strong demand, and a lack of
production capacity induced them to step up investments.
Meanwhile, housing investments started to flatten after
years of acceleration. The external sector benefited from
relatively high growth in world trade on the back of strong
international demand.
Global trade under pressure
Various signs point to global expansion having reached its
peak in 2018, with the clearest sign of a slowdown being
the persistent fall in confidence indicators. During the
year, growth in world trade, industrial production and
global GDP all weakened. This was partly for cyclical
reasons as pent-up demand waned and the inventory
cycle started running out of steam. In addition, inflation
rose in response to higher energy prices and held back
the increase in consumer purchasing power. The threat
of protectionism also contributed to the declining
confidence, while the political uncertainty created by
Brexit and concerns about the Italian budget impacted
sentiment. Business surveys meanwhile showed a
substantial drop in export orders. Moreover, restrictive
measures by Chinese policymakers aimed at deleveraging
the economy reduced GDP growth in China, while
the rate hikes and shortening of the balance sheet by
the Federal Reserve also resulted in tighter financial
conditions in many other countries.
ECB preparing for QE withdrawal
On the back of higher commodity prices, headline inflation
rose towards the ECB’s 2% target, while core inflation,
which disregards volatile price components, remained
much lower. Technological change, growing international
competition and a more flexible labour market continued
to hold back price rises. However, the ECB repeatedly
stated that it expects core inflation to rise, with ongoing
economic growth and a further improvement in the labour
market propping up the pressure on prices. Given this
prospect, the ECB gradually reduced the degree of policy
accommodation. Its first step was to reduce its monthly
asset purchases, while the second step was to announce
plans to cease purchases completely by the end of 2018
and then raise the deposit rate. Credit spreads materially
widened in 2018, but came down again when signals
of a slowing economy became more clear and the ECB
notified markets it was about to inject more liquidity into
the European banking system and would not raise official
rates before 2020.
Rapidly rising house prices
After reaching a historic high in 2017, Dutch housing
transaction volume started declining in 2018. While
the deceleration was initially confined to the Randstad
conurbation, it later also became visible in other parts of
the country. The decline was primarily caused by a lack of
properties for sale. In response to this shortage, but also
because of strong economic growth, the favourable labour

market, low mortgage interest rates and demand from
buy-to-let investors, nominal house prices rose beyond
their pre-crisis levels. However, regional differences are
substantial. Moreover, the construction of new homes
is continuing to fall well short of demand. Dutch
housebuilders’ slow response to market changes is a
long-standing problem, which the government is trying
to address. The problem will however take a long time
to resolve, given the limited number of building permits.
The fact that buyers are struggling to find suitable homes
is taking its toll on sentiment in the housing market,
which is still positive, albeit less buoyant than before.
Marginal growth in lending
Despite the decline in housing transactions, mortgage
production in the Netherlands continued to increase.
A large share of mortgage production was attributable
to refinancing by homeowners seeking to lock into low
mortgage interest rates. At the same time, many other
people redeemed all or part of their mortgage to reduce
debt. As a result, the total amount of outstanding mortgage
debt rose only moderately, and even shrank as a percentage
of GDP. Thanks to the sharp increase in house prices and
the rise in redemptions, the number of households in
negative equity declined substantially during the year.
Lending to non-financial businesses continued to decline,
albeit less rapidly than before. Instead of using banks,
businesses are now increasingly relying on internal funds,
equity and corporate bonds to finance their investments.
The low interest rate environment is inducing investors to
explore a wider realm of investment opportunities and
increasingly to flock to corporate bonds. As a result, direct
financing options have become more accessible,
particularly for larger businesses.
Weaker growth outlook
We expect the US growth momentum to wane, mainly
driven by the slowdown in investments, which have been
very strong in the past two years. While US government
spending will pick up some of the slack, this will come
to an end in 2019. Although the rivalry between the US
and China is likely to persist, we do not expect China
to experience a hard landing as the government is taking
offsetting measures to ensure the country’s economic
slowdown is of a more gradual nature. Weakened
confidence and less supportive financial conditions will
affect activity in the eurozone. However, the European
economy still has some slack. Since the upward effect
of oil prices will be only temporary, the rise in inflation
is likely to be slow. The overall contribution of external
demand will become less supportive for the Netherlands,
although domestic spending will continue to grow
robustly. Dutch GDP growth will also receive a boost
from the increase in public spending that was agreed in
the Coalition Agreement. As capacity constraints meant
the government had to postpone some of its intended
spending in 2018, some of the positive effects of this
on GDP growth will roll over to 2019.

Strategy and performance
Introduction
ABN AMRO operates in a highly regulated sector, where
regulations are also continually changing. The 2018 financial
year saw over 30 significant regulatory developments that
were either new or required substantial implementation
efforts from ABN AMRO. Some of the key developments
during the year are highlighted below.
Sustainability developments in financial legislation
On 8 March 2018 the European Commission unveiled
its Action Plan on sustainable finance. This was followed
on 24 May 2018 by the Commission’s presentation of
a package of measures that included three proposals
aimed at:
Å establishing a unified EU classification system of
sustainable economic activities (i.e. a ‘taxonomy’);
Å improving the disclosure requirements on how
institutional investors integrate environmental,
social and governance (ESG) factors into their
risk processes; and
Å creating a new category of benchmarks to help investors
compare the carbon footprint of their investments.
In addition, the European Commission sought feedback
on amendments to delegated acts under the Markets
in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II) and the
Insurance Distribution Directive (IDD), with the aim of
including ESG considerations in the advice that investment
firms and insurance distributors offer to individual clients.
These amended delegated acts are expected to be
adopted in 2019-2022.
Brexit
On 23 June 2016 the UK voted to leave the EU. Brexit
is now scheduled for 29 March 2019. Planning for Brexit,
however, has been difficult against the uncertain political
and regulatory backdrop. This has been primarily because
of the drawn-out negotiations for a withdrawal agreement,
which have been affecting the entire financial market.
The transition deal agreed between the UK and the EU in
early 2018, which is intended to last until the end of 2020,
provides for a smooth transition and legal continuity after
Brexit on 29 March 2019. However, this transition period
is inextricably linked to the withdrawal agreement;
without the latter, there will be no post-Brexit transition.
And although the UK and the EU reached such agreement
in November 2018, uncertainties remain about whether
this withdrawal agreement will survive.
Without a withdrawal agreement, EU financial
services’ passporting rights will cease to apply after
Brexit, and appropriate local authorisations will then
be needed by parties wanting to conduct business.
The UK government has announced that, if necessary,
it will introduce a temporary permissions regime for
inbound passporting of European Economic Area (EEA)
firms and funds. This will provide a backstop in the
absence of a bilaterally agreed transition period and if
the EU passporting regime falls away. An area of particular
concern has been the continuing uncertainty about access
to UK financial market infrastructures and to London’s
clearing houses. Because of the many uncertainties
and the protracted negotiations, the ECB has instructed
banks to prepare for a hard, ‘cliff-edge’ Brexit and to make
contingency plans for a ‘no-deal’ outcome.
Finalisation of Basel III reforms (Basel IV)
The finalised Basel III standards of 7 December 2017
(Basel IV) imply a major change in the way banks have
to determine their risk-weighted assets (RWAs) when
calculating their minimum regulatory capital. Basel IV will
limit the use of internal risk models to those exposure
classes for which more default data are available (i.e.
retail, small corporate and specialised lending exposures).
In addition, a revised standardised approach for calculating
credit risk and operational risk, a revised credit valuation
adjustment (CVA) risk framework and a revised leverage
ratio framework are being introduced. Lastly, where
capital requirements are calculated on the basis of internal
models, an output floor has been set at 72.5% of the
outcome of the calculation based on standardised
approaches. This output floor means that institutions
basing their calculations on internal models will be
required also to apply the revised standardised approaches
when calculating their RWAs. Basel IV is due to be
transposed into EU law in the Capital Requirements
Directive (CRD) and the Capital Requirements Regulation
(CRR) and will enter into force during a transition period
from 2022 onwards.
Reforms of Interbank Offered Rates
Interbank Offered Rates (IBORs) are broadly used in
financial markets as benchmark interest rates for a wide
range of products, including derivatives, deposits and
mortgages. As the existing IBORs are increasingly likely
to disappear over the coming years, financial market
participants need to prepare for their replacements.
Although no clear view has yet been formed on the
composition of any new benchmark interest rates and
the dates on which they can start to be used, the first
IBOR-related reforms may start taking effect in 2019.

General Data Protection Regulation
The EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
became effective on 25 May 2018 in replacement of the
EU Data Protection Directive. The existing Dutch Data
Protection Act (Wet bescherming persoonsgegevens)
was consequently repealed, while the powers of the
Dutch Data Protection Authority were expanded to include
such things as the right to impose administrative fines.
The GDPR aims to reinforce the data protection rights of
individuals and to facilitate the free flow of personal data
in the digital single market. Its requirements are stricter
than those that applied under the Data Protection Directive.
Payment Services Directive II
A key objective of the EU Payment Services Directive II
(PSD II) is to create a level playing field for all payment
service providers, both incumbents and new entrants.
Under PSD II, third parties may obtain access to details
of payment accounts at banks and so start offering
payment initiation and account information services.
Therefore, going forward, these parties may play a larger
role in the payment system. Dutch legislation implementing
PSD II was adopted in December 2018 and entered
into force in February 2019.

Strategy
Accelerate the sustainability shift
The sustainability shift in society and in our clients’
business models offers new opportunities for ABN AMRO.
We want to remain relevant and responsible, both now
and in the future. So we are taking a stand with a positive
and proactive purpose: “Banking for better, for generations
to come.” And we have refreshed our strategy to put that
purpose at the centre of everything we do.
For us, this means being better for our customers and
better for society. It means rethinking our mindset to
ensure we have entrepreneurial, energised employees
innovating to create the effortless experiences that clients
expect, while also building a future-proof bank with strong
business results. Supporting the 400,000 companies
and 5 million private individuals who are our clients in
their transition to sustainability is a business opportunity
to capture. We will be designing models that support
inclusion and a fairer society, and developing products that
promote the transition to a more circular economy and help
reduce emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases.
Our ambitious strategy goes beyond purely financial value:
it is about creating lasting value for all stakeholders.
We want to accelerate the sustainability shift. Our strategy
is based on three pillars: supporting our clients’ transition
to sustainability, reinventing the customer experience,
and building a future-proof bank. This is because helping
clients shift to sustainable ways of working and living
means giving them a flawless experience. And to do that,
we need high-performing people and processes. That is
why we want to nurture a culture of energetic, engaged,
well-trained employees and connected processes.
Support our clients’ transition to sustainability
We want to support our clients’ transition to sustainable
products and business models, and will use our data,
knowledge and expertise to do so in a profitable way.
We want to make a positive impact by doing what we
are good at – banking. To support our clients’ transition
to a more sustainable era, we have set three priorities:
Å Innovate to support our clients in their sustainability
journey;
Å Embed sustainability in our current products,
services and client touchpoints;
Å Lead by example and living our purpose.
Reinvent the customer experience
ABN AMRO is a client-focused and data-driven
organisation that treasures the client relationship and
delivers an effortless and recognisable experience.
We aspire to satisfy fundamental client needs and
to ‘wow’ in the customer experience. To reinvent the
customer experience, we have set four priorities:
Å Improve clients’ immediate pain points – including
new client take-on, credit applications, instant help
and track & trace – and their future pain points;
Å Reinvent end-to-end customer journeys from scratch;
Å Invest in capabilities that help us anticipate and respond
to changing client needs;
Å Enable the organisation to deliver an excellent
customer experience and embed a client-focused culture.
Build a future-proof bank
Our organisation unleashes the potential of our people
throughout their careers and fully equips them to
successfully contribute to our purpose and strategy,
with focus, engagement and high productivity. In seeking
to become a future-proof bank, we have set two priorities:
Å To offer our people a great employee experience
in a purpose-led and values-driven culture;
Å To design organisational structures, processes and
IT systems that make work easier and help us fully
realise our three strategic pillars.

of financial services, but also as an employer and an
investor. At the same time, we recognise that, through
our business activities, we may also decrease value – if,
for example, we close bank branches or invest in projects
reliant on natural resources. Our value creation model
is based on the IIRC’s integrated reporting framework,
which recognises six forms of capital – financial, human,
intellectual, manufactured, natural, and social and
relationship. Our model shows the flow of the value we
consume – from the resources, or capital, we need to
run our business – to the financial, social and economic
value we create (or deplete) as a result of our activities.
We regularly assess our operating environment in order
to identify the most important social, economic, financial
and environmental issues, and where we believe we
can create value for our stakeholders. This assessment
is based on input from stakeholders and senior

management. Based on their input, we identified
over 300 social, economic, financial and environmental
issues and narrowed them down to just nine ‘strategic
differentiators’ linking directly to our strategy. We also
identified other ‘fundamental value creators’, which
are basic ‘hygiene’ factors, such as secure banking,
compliance and data protection, that will support the
implementation of our strategy. See also our Integrated
Annual Review 2018 on abnamro.com/annualreport.
Sustainable Development Goals
The United Nations launched its Sustainable Development
Goals in 2015. There are 17 goals, on topics ranging from
poverty and hunger to human rights and climate change.
We have identified three ‘strategic’ goals – where we
believe, through our strategy, we have the most to
contribute, both as an investor and as a provider of
financial services. We have mapped out our contributions
to each of our three strategic SDGs below:
Å Decent work and economic growth (SDG 8) “Promote
sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth,
full and productive employment and decent work for all.”
Å Human rights and labour standards built into
ABN AMRO’s lending, investment and procurement
policies;
Å Loans and support to small and mediumsized businesses to help them expand,
drive economic growth and create new jobs;
Å Social impact bonds: raising funds to help young
people on state benefits into work.
Å Responsible consumption and production (SDG 12)
“Ensure sustainable consumption and production
patterns.”
Å Loans to upgrade infrastructure, improve energy
efficiency and retrofit industries with cleaner
technologies;
Å EUR 1 billion financing for at least 100 circular
economy activities by 2020.
Å Climate action (SDG 13) “Take urgent action to combat
climate change and its impacts.”
Å Mission 2030: upgrading clients’ residential
and commercial properties to an average label
of A for energy efficiency;
Å Green financing through our green bonds, energy
transition fund and Green Bank in the Netherlands;
Å Increasing clients’ sustainable investments to
more than EUR 16 billion;
Å Increasing our sustainability financing to
EUR 3 billion by 2020;
Å Increasing our renewable energy commitment
to 20% of our energy portfolio by 2020.

Anti-money laundering
Banks have a responsibility to help protect the financial services sector. We
take this responsibility very seriously. ABN AMRO invests significant resources
in combating financial crime. We work closely with regulators, governments,
other banks and the police. 
ABN AMRO has decided, based on existing shortcomings and input from the
Dutch Central Bank, to accelerate its Customer Due Diligence (CDD) programme in
order to be compliant with anti-money laundering and terrorist financing legislation.
We’ve already carried out a review of our Corporate & Institutional Banking business;
a review of our Private Banking clients is now nearly complete. ABN AMRO has
developed remediation programmes to speed up remediation actions in relation to
International Card Services (ICS) and Commercial Banking and has shared these with
the Dutch Central Bank and committed to their execution. For the incremental external
costs involved, we’ve taken a provision in 2018 of EUR 85 million – for ICS
(EUR 30 million) and Commercial Banking (EUR 55 million). The amount is based on,
among other items, the total number of files, the time needed to review each file and
the percentage that will be reviewed using external resources. 
Over the past year, a number of European banks have been the object of money
laundering investigations. We recognise that, with financial crime, we have to be
vigilant. We’re constantly looking for ways to strengthen our systems and raise
awareness of potential risks within the bank.

Analysis
ABN AMRO’s profit amounted to EUR 2,325 million. The
decrease of EUR 466 million compared with full-year 2017
was mainly attributable to the proceeds, recorded in 2017,
of the PB Asia divestment and the effect of model
refinements driving impairment releases. The return on
equity for 2018 was 11.4%, compared with 14.5% in 2017
(13.4% if adjusted for the PB Asia divestment). If adjusted
for incidentals, the operating result improved because of
net interest income being boosted by corporate loan
growth backed by resilient margins and the lower cost
levels that resulted from restructuring measures.
Net interest income increased by EUR 137 million to
EUR 6,593 (2017: EUR 6,456 million) on the back of
corporate loan growth and higher mortgage penalties.
Interest income on residential mortgages remained stable
as average volumes and margins were broadly flat despite
intensifying competition. Interest income on consumer
loans was down, due to a combination of lower volumes
and margins.
Net fee and commission income decreased by EUR 48 million
to EUR 1,699 million (2017: EUR 1,747 million). A third of
this decrease was attributable to the PB Asia divestment
as the figures for 2017 included four months of fee
contributions from this business. The remainder was
primarily attributable to Private Banking as financial
markets were more favourable in 2017. The decrease
was partly offset, however, by higher fees charged for
Retail Banking payment packages and by higher fees in
the Clearing business following greater market volatility
in 2018.
Other operating income decreased to EUR 800 million in
2018 (2017: EUR 1,086 million). Excluding the PB Asia
divestment and incidentals recorded in both years,
other operating income decreased due to lower hedge
accounting-related income, including the effects of the
partial sale of the Public Sector Loan (PSL) portfolio
(EUR 79 million versus EUR 181 million in 2017),
adverse results for CVA/DVA/FVA (EUR 3 million negative
versus EUR 75 million in 2017) and a less favourable
equity stake revaluation in 2018 mainly in Commercial
Banking. This decrease was largely offset by better
results for equity participations (2018: EUR 274 million;
2017: EUR 114 million).
Personnel expenses decreased by EUR 149 million in
2018 to EUR 2,441 million. Part of this decrease was
attributable to lower restructuring provisions in 2018
(EUR 129 million versus EUR 156 million in 2017).
If adjusted for restructuring provisions, personnel
expenses are on a declining trend. This reflects the lower
FTE levels resulting from the continued progress being
achieved by cost-saving programmes. However, this
progress was partly offset in 2018 by wage inflation as
the new Collective Labour Agreement provided for a 2%
increase in salaries from 1 January 2018 and for a one-off
payment of EUR 16 million in 2018.
Provision for SME derivatives-related issues
The provision for project costs relating to SME derivatives-related issues was
increased by EUR 41 million in 2018, compared with an addition of EUR 139 million
in 2017.
Restructuring provisions
Personnel expenses in 2018 includes EUR 129 million of restructuring provisions
for further digitalisation, process optimisation and the CIB refocus, compared with
EUR 164 million in 2017.

Introduction Strategy and performance Risk, funding & capital Leadership Governance Annual Financial Statements Other
Strategy and performance / Group performance / Financial review 15
Other expenses decreased by EUR 82 million in 2018
to EUR 2,910 million. This was largely due to lower
incidentals, partly offset by higher regulatory levies.
Excluding the incidentals and higher regulatory levies,
other expenses fell as a result of cost-saving programmes.
The effects of these cost-saving programmes were partly
offset, however, by higher costs incurred for the external
staff hired to increase our short-term capacity for regulatory
projects. Regulatory levies increased by EUR 36 million to
EUR 336 million, mainly due to a higher Single Resolution
Fund contribution.
Impairment charges on financial instruments amounted to
EUR 655 million in 2018, compared with a release of
EUR 63 million in 2017. Despite the continued favourable
trend in overall credit quality and the positive
macroeconomic environment, impairment charges rose
in 2018, mainly in CIB and Commercial Banking, reflecting
additional impairment charges in energy (mainly offshore),
shipping, commodities, diamonds and healthcare.
Impairment releases in 2017 benefited from model
refinements and a model update. The cost of risk
amounted to 24bps in 2018, which was below the
through-the-cycle level of 25-30bps.

Main developments in assets
Total assets decreased to EUR 381.3 billion
(2017: EUR 393.2 billion). The decline was largely driven
by lower loans and advances to banks and customers,
securities financing and derivatives.
Derivatives decreased to EUR 6.2 billion (2017:
EUR 9.8 billion) on the back of mid- to long-term interest
and FX rate movements impacting on the valuation of
derivatives and also mirrored in derivatives liabilities.
Financial investments increased to EUR 42.2 billion
(2017: EUR 41.0 billion), mainly due to USD investments.

mainly in Global Markets and Clearing. Residential
mortgages decreased by EUR 1.8 billion, largely due
to lower origination as a result of maintaining pricing
discipline in a competitive environment. Consumer
loans remained broadly stable, whereas corporate loans
increased by EUR 5.8 billion. The growth of EUR 1.8 billion
in Commercial Banking was reflected across all sectors
on the back of the strong Dutch economy. CIB client loans
increased by EUR 3.7 billion (including EUR 1.2 billion
attributable to the impact of the USD appreciation), mainly
in corporates in the Netherlands and Natural Resources
and partly offset by the decline in Trade and Commodity
Finance, including diamonds. The rate of growth slowed
in 2018 following the CIB refocus, which is expected
to gradually impact on volumes throughout 2020.

Non-financial review
The following sub-sections are based on the reporting
requirements set out in Section 2:391, paragraphs 1 and 5,
of the Dutch Civil Code (Burgerlijk Wetboek) pertaining
to non-financial information.
Employee experience
We aspire to build a future-proof bank that unleashes
the potential of our people and fully equips them to
successfully contribute to our purpose and strategy.
Our people are our most valuable asset as ABN AMRO
can only properly serve its clients if it has a highly
talented and committed workforce. We therefore offer
our people a highly valued, integrated and relevant
employee experience in a purpose-led and values-driven
culture. We believe in an open corporate culture in which
employees have a say and are encouraged to help build
the organisation. In October 2018, we conducted our
latest global Employee Engagement Survey (EES). With
18,510 people (internal and external staff) completing
the survey, the response rate was 78%, making the
results representative. Our engagement index score
rose from 79 to 80. This is on-target (80) and comparable
to the Global Financial Services norm of 81 in 2019.
Talent and development
ABN AMRO aims to create long-term value for its clients,
employees and investors, as well as for society as a
whole. Attracting new talents and investing in employee
development is a prerequisite for creating long-term value.
These investments come in the form of formal training,
supervision, coaching, on-the-job learning and mandatory
training to develop our professional knowledge. We have
modified our performance management system in order
to give employees a greater sense of ownership of the
role that their personal and professional development play
in contributing to our strategy. The new system focuses
on having the right type of dialogue and on creating
a feedback culture.
Investment and appreciation
In 2018 we made significant investments in employer
branding and talent sourcing and in optimising our journey
to attract talent. We are also continuing to invest in
employee training and development in order to accelerate
skill building. These investments account for around 1.8%
of our overall personnel costs.
We measure the extent to which staff appreciate Talent
and Development opportunities in our annual Employee
Engagement Survey. Overall satisfaction with Talent
and Development stood at 78% in 2018, which was
3 percentage points higher than that of our industry peers.
We value these results as it is important, in a rapidly
changing world, for employees to feel encouraged
to continue working on their personal development.
Transformation
The transformation team was formed in mid-2017 to design,
accelerate and support the bank-wide transformation in
cooperation with HR. Over the past year, our transformation
efforts focused primarily on further aligning our strategic
ambitions and corporate culture with the bank’s purpose
of “Banking for better, for generations to come”. These
transformation efforts now serve as a clear imperative
and as a framework for the bank’s ongoing transformation
into a purpose-led business. Our executive management
teams have worked in partnership with our transformation
facilitators to strengthen the teams’ leadership capabilities
and practices so that they can lead and manage the
transformation of their respective businesses and
organisations and give our employees clear insight
into ABN AMRO’s vision and direction.
Diversity and inclusion 
To be successful, we need to have a diverse workforce
that reflects the communities we serve. An inclusive
environment plays a pivotal role in developing an open
culture. ABN AMRO’s commitment to diversity and
inclusion includes promoting equal treatment and equal
opportunities for employees, preventing harassment
and ensuring non-discrimination.
ABN AMRO pursued various diversity initiatives in 2018,
including externally and internally organised mentoring
programmes, such as the Career Accelerator Programme,
for women and for employees with a bicultural background.
We have also set up a dedicated taskforce to accelerate
the advancement of our non-Western colleagues.
To further professionalise the process of hiring people
with a disability and also support existing colleagues with
a disability, we have set up the B-Able Desk to respond
to questions from employees and managers and to
provide help in the form of coaching and practical advice.
We have also launched the Sign Language Coffee Bar,
where colleagues order their coffee in sign language from
a hearing-impaired barista. In addition, we have boosted
our Warm Welcome project by hiring thirty staff with an
employment disability in various offices throughout
the country.
Over the years, substantial numbers of refugees have
come to the Netherlands and requested political asylum.
Those allowed to stay are called status holders. We have

Strategy and performance
launched the Reboot initiative to help status holders find
their way in the Dutch labour market by giving them an
opportunity to work and build a career at ABN AMRO.
In July 2018 we were one of the first companies in
the Netherlands to sign the ‘Talent to the Top’ Cultural
Diversity Charter. By doing so, ABN AMRO committed
itself to a concrete and self-determined objective for
appointing non-Western talent to top and subtop positions.
Having set a target of 7% for non-Western staff in subtop
positions and 6% in top positions by 2020, we were able
in 2018 to achieve a 4.4% share for subtop positions and
3.4% for top positions. We have also set up a series of
Diversity Circles and the Diversity Table to further engage
our network.
The 2018 LGBT+ survey showed a positive tendency in
attitudes within the bank. Most of our employees have
a positive stance on LGBT+ colleagues. The bank has
also signed the UN standards of conduct supporting
the business community in tackling discrimination against
LGBT+ people and the Sustainable Development Goals
in the LGBTI Manifesto (SDG LGBTI).
Detecting financial crime
ABN AMRO acknowledges the importance of its role
as a gatekeeper in safeguarding the financial system
against financial crime. It therefore focuses on seeking to
continually improve its procedures, systems and controls
in order to reflect our beliefs and live up to our regulatory
and societal obligations and expectations, to minimise
the risk of being involved in or associated with money
laundering, the financing of terrorism, bribery, corruption
and tax evasion and to comply with economic sanctions.
ABN AMRO has programmes in place to bolster its
resilience to financial crime and unethical and illegal
behaviour and to strengthen its governance regarding
the detecting of financial crime.
Client and third-party integrity
Both before entering into and during business relationships,
ABN AMRO carries out due diligence on its prospective
clients and third parties such as agents, intermediaries
and suppliers. ABN AMRO does this, using a risk-based
approach, to minimise the risk of being involved in
or associated with money laundering, the financing
of terrorism, bribery, corruption or tax evasion. 
ABN AMRO systematically monitors the activities of its
clients and reports any suspicious or unusual transactions
to the relevant authorities. In high-risk situations (such as
those involving politically exposed persons or adverse
media, or clients in countries or sectors with an inherently
higher risk of financial crime), prospective and existing
clients undergo additional due diligence. The bank also
considers geopolitical factors when assessing the risks
of financial crime in relation to specific countries or
sectors. Unacceptable risks lead to a client exit or, in the
case of prospective clients or third parties, to rejection.
The Q4 2018 figures included a provision of EUR 85 million
in Retail Banking (ICS) and Commercial Banking for
additional costs of accelerating Customer Due Diligence
(CDD) remediation programmes. See note 29 Provisions
of the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements for
further information.
Combating bribery and corruption
Corruption undermines fair and competitive business,
restricts international trade, reduces investor confidence,
and impacts on regional and global economic growth
and international stability.
In addition to the risks posed to the financial system,
ABN AMRO itself can also face reputational and financial
risks from potentially becoming directly exposed to or
being abused for corrupt practices. We take these risks
seriously and take mitigating measures to limit them.
It is our corporate social responsibility to conduct business
with integrity and without any form of bribery and corruption.
Organisational and employee integrity
All staff members undergo mandatory training to
recognise signs of financial crime, including ‘red flags’
of money laundering, bribery, corruption and conflicts
of interest. It is ABN AMRO’s policy for all actual or
suspected incidents, irregularities or breaches relating
to bribery and corruption to be reported immediately.
Employees are encouraged, where possible, to first
discuss such suspicions with their manager. If this is
undesirable for any reason, they should report their
suspicions through the bank’s whistleblowing channels,
which are also open to external parties.
In accordance with regulatory requirements, we monitor
the risks of money laundering, the financing of terrorism,
bribery and corruption in our organisation so as to maintain
a strong control system and to mitigate the risks. The risks
of money laundering, the financing of terrorism, bribery
and corruption are assessed as part of our Systematic
Integrity Risk Analysis (SIRA), which is based on qualitative
and quantitative information and creates awareness
of the inherent and residual integrity risks faced by
ABN AMRO. In addition to the SIRA, ABN AMRO
continually works to create data-driven insight into
integrity risks. More information can be found in our
anti-bribery and corruption policy.

Resilience to security threats
We have an information security framework in place that
defines management and staff responsibilities and sets
out security directives applying to the bank, its vendors
and third parties with whom the bank exchanges
information. The Corporate Information Security Office
(CISO) systematically monitors client transactions in order
to detect fraudulent transactions. Security and Integrity
Management (SIM) monitors and reports the number
of detected issues relating to fraud, information security
and compliance breaches, while also monitoring losses
suffered by the bank’s clients and the bank itself. In
addition, ABN AMRO has a security framework in place
to manage the risk of, and prevent, financial crime and
unethical behaviour. Before introducing new products
and services, the bank uses Change Risk Assessments
(CRA) to assess the potential risks related to these
products and services, including the possibility of fraud.
The bank is focused on raising awareness among clients
and employees of how to recognise and prevent financial
and economic crime. The bank cooperates with other
banks, as well as with the police and justice departments,
to shield financial transactions from potential criminals.
Cybercrime
ABN AMRO’s information infrastructures connect the
bank’s networks to public networks. As a result, banking
processes and their supporting information systems
are inherently vulnerable. This vulnerability threatens
the security and availability of client data and services.
The bank faces a constant threat of cybercrime, including
computer-assisted fraud, unauthorised disclosure of
confidential information, virus infections, computer
hacking and denial of service attacks. 
In the first quarter of 2018, ABN AMRO experienced
multiple Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks via
a relatively new method. Most of these attacks were
successfully mitigated and had minimal impact on clients
and employees. ABN AMRO filed several police reports
and is actively sharing information with the police and
other banks, through the Electronic Crimes Task Force,
to support the ongoing police investigations.
We have established a structured approach to information
security in recognition of the importance of protecting
the information and associated assets, such as systems
and infrastructures, of our clients and of the bank.
This is designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity
and availability of information at all times. This approach
defines the organisational framework, the management
and staff responsibilities, and the information security
directives applying to the bank, its vendors and third
parties with whom the bank exchanges information.
As part of this approach, the bank continuously monitors
cybercrime threats and adapts the bank’s defences
wherever necessary.
Responsible tax 
It is our corporate social responsibility to pay our
share of tax. We communicate on our tax approach
transparently and publish our tax principles on the
ABN AMRO website. Our tax principles illustrate
how we fulfil our social responsibility relating to tax.
Our tax policy is based on these principles and
provides guidance on what we believe is responsible
tax behaviour for the whole ABN AMRO Group, both
regarding our own affairs and in our dealings with clients.
Actions to improve tax control in 2018
In 2018 we implemented further measures to increase
our management of tax risks. Tax is part of our Risk
Management Cycle. Tax evasion and tax integrity are
both part of our Systematic Integrity Risk Analysis (SIRA),
which supports our risk-based approach to all integrity
risks, including tax risks. Tax was also a risk theme during
2018 and will continue to be so in 2019. Group Tax is
involved in all relevant risk and control self-assessments.
Tax risks are assessed in conjunction with the businesses
where these arise. Any key tax risks identified are
monitored and the controls in place are tested. 
Tax embedded in client and product approval procedures
Our client acceptance and review procedures include
a review of potential tax evasion – which is never
acceptable – and also review clients from a tax integrity
perspective. Group Tax supports relationship managers
in assessing clients’ tax positions and in defining
appropriate actions. We consult and discuss tax integrity
with relevant clients. As well as the tax awareness
sessions that Group Tax continued arranging for clientfacing staff in 2018, we have also included questions
on tax in our standard training programmes for all staff.
As we wish to steer clear of aggressive tax planning
and tax avoidance, our intention is to offer products that
comply with the intention and spirit of the law and that
are commercial rather than tax-driven. This approach
is also reflected in our tax principles and tax policy
and embedded in the product approval process. 
Transparency
Our tax principles and tax policy and our aim to be a
good corporate citizen support our objective to pay our
share of tax. We report taxable income in each country
we operate in and in line with the value created in that
specific country. The country-by-country report in note 10
of the Annual Financial Statements shows, among other
things, our revenue and tax expense for each country.
We met our legal obligation under the FATCA (Foreign
Account Tax Compliance Act) and Common Reporting
Standards (CRS) regulations to report information on
our clients to the tax authorities in 2018. We are currently
reviewing the impact of the new EU Directive on Mandatory
Disclosure (also known as DAC6) on our business and
reporting obligations.

Cum/ex transactions
ABN AMRO’s legal predecessor, Fortis Bank (Nederland) N.V.,
ABN AMRO and several (former) subsidiaries were directly
or indirectly involved in so-called cum/ex transactions in
the past. This has been the subject of discussions between
ABN AMRO and the German tax authorities for the
past years. Currently, there are no disputes between
the German tax authorities and ABN AMRO relating to
these transactions. Since 2010, a number of subsidiaries
associated with these transactions have been sold by
means of a management buy-out and the desks of
ABN AMRO that were (directly or indirectly) involved in
these trading strategies have been closed. That does not
mean, however, that there are no legal risks remaining
with regard to these transactions in particular civil and/or
criminal law risks.
In the second half of 2018 public reports appeared on the
involvement of subsidiaries of ABN AMRO or former Fortis
in dividend stripping activities and particularly in so-called
cum-ex activities in the past. This has raised questions
in Dutch parliament. In as far as these questions were
directed to ABN AMRO itself these questions have been
answered. The Dutch Minister of Finance has answered
further questions on 3 December 2018. In case Dutch or
foreign authorities request information on these activities,
ABN AMRO co-operates in these investigations as required
by law, or beyond as long as it does not potentially harm
the position of other stakeholders. For further information
we refer to our website.

Retail Banking
Business description
Retail Banking provides a full range of transparent banking
products and high-quality services to individuals. We have
a proven track record in delivering products and services
under the ABN AMRO brand, and specific products and
services under other labels. Our operations provide a
seamless omni-channel distribution network for our
clients, with extensive digital and physical coverage.
Retail Banking has a strong foundation and a recognised
market position in the Netherlands. In 2018 we retained
our strong foothold in the Dutch market and maintained
our number three primary bank position for retail clients
(20% of the Dutch population). ABN AMRO captured a
number 2 market position in new mortgage production
in 2018, with a combined market share of all ABN AMRO
brands in the Dutch mortgage market of approximately
17%. Retail and Private Banking held a combined market
share of 21% in the savings and deposits market.
We are also continually adjusting our service model to
better match the needs of our clients and to maintain
our position for the future. We have decided to maximise
our focus on the digital transformation in our product
and service offering, where we are now shifting towards
a digital-first service concept and aiming to become
a frontrunner in the market.
Business developments
Introduction
The banking sector is undergoing significant transformation.
We are facing societal and banking trends that are shaping
the context in which we operate, as well as experiencing
competition from many different directions. New players
are entering the market, while technological and regulatory
developments are changing the competitive landscape
and traditional ways of banking. During the year we
continued seeking to achieve our ambition of being at the
forefront of digitalisation and technological developments
so that we can deliver innovative products and solutions,
enhance the client experience and provide relevant and
personal expertise. In order to continue delivering in our
business we will use the strategy refresh as a guideline,
with ‘Banking for better’ as the basis for embedding our
strategic pillars of reinventing the customer experience,
sustainability and building a future-proof bank.
Supporting our clients’ transition to sustainability
ABN AMRO is committed to the preconditions of the
International Energy Agency’s 2-degree scenario. The main
way in which ABN AMRO can have an impact in this
respect is by making real estate more sustainable.
ABN AMRO is therefore aiming for all our real estate,
including our own offices and Retail branches, to average
energy label ‘A’ by 2030. As at 31 December 2018 we had
104,657 ‘label A’ houses in our mortgage portfolio,
representing an increase of 23.3% on the position at the
2017 year-end. Good progress has also been achieved in
various ongoing initiatives in the mortgage market, while
multiple initiatives have been started in the Personal
Banking domain to help vulnerable groups such as the
elderly. These include making more use of financial
coaches and encouraging elderly people to use digital
and video banking.
Retail Banking is currently looking into opportunities to
broaden the scope of and prospects for sustainability.
Multiple initiatives have already been launched as part of
our Mission 2030, including the energy-savings check. In
addition, we are taking steps to guide vulnerable clients
towards a more responsible approach to credit. During the
year we also worked with Green Choice to launch a new,
sustainably-themed savings account for children.
Reinventing the customer experience
Retail Banking plans to build on its success, its track
record for delivery and its chosen route in the field of
customer experience and digitalisation. We will position
our digital offering, customer journey and data capabilities
as true enablers for our products and processes, while
seeking opportunities to broaden our role in selected
ecosystems.
We added more self-service features to our Mobile
Banking app in 2018. These additions, which are designed
to ensure our digital offering maintains a leading position,
included the launch of the chatbot Anna and iDIN mobile.
We also maintained our top-class ranking in the app stores
(with scores in the Apple App store and Google Playstore
of 4.5 and 4.4 respectively, on a scale of 1 to 5). Meanwhile,
Banking.nl ranked our mobile banking app as the best
Dutch mobile banking app. As for our other apps, we
expanded the user base of Tikkie (5 million+ users), GRIP
(500,000+ users) and the &Meer loyalty programme
(250,000+ users). The Net Promoter Score in 2018 was
-9 (2017: -9).
In 2018, we opened the first Office 3.0 in Amstelveen
(Netherlands). This office was developed based on the
needs of our customers, with the central focus being on
the shift to digital. Examples of the new features include
meeting rooms that can be used for video banking, and
the video wall displaying information about our products.

Strategy and performance
Retail received several awards during the year, including
the ‘Rookie of the Year’ award for Speech Analytics, the
Sterrenregen award for ABN AMRO’s car insurance, the
Dutch Consumers Association’s ‘Best of the Test’ award
for our legal aid insurance and, for the fourth year in a row,
a 5-star award from MoneyView for our travel insurance.
Last but not least, in October 2018 ABN AMRO was
awarded the ‘Gouden spreekbuis’, a prize for excellent
mortgage customer service.
Building a future-proof bank
By building a future-proof bank, we want to achieve
maximal flexibility through a simpler product assortment,
lean process flows and systems, and empowered
employees. In the Mortgage domain the comprehensive
optimisation programme we recently completed across
the chain has achieved strong results. While we are
continuing to further improve and digitalise our mortgage
activities, we are also shifting our focus to another strategic
important portfolio: consumer credit. Driven by our ambition
to remain a responsible consumer credit provider, with a
sustainable business model, we will be optimising and
rationalising our entire consumer credit chain over the
next few years. As well as optimising our core product
groups, including the underlying process flows and
systems, we are continuing to empower our employees
by, for example, taking the next steps in promoting
agile ways of working and further embedding the shift to
self-organising. We are also well positioned to participate
in and build business models outside the traditional
banking channels, with Tikkie as our best example to date.
Overall, the Employee Engagement Survey showed
the engagement score (80%) to have remained almost
the same as in 2017 (81%). 
Financial review
Financial highlights
Å Profit for the period decreased by 15%, mainly due to
lower operating income and lower impairment releases.
Å Net interest income decreased by 3%, primarily due
to the impact of a model update for non-maturing
deposits. Interest income on mortgages remained
stable despite the competitive environment, while
consumer loans saw lower volumes and margins
year-on-year.
Å Operating expenses decreased owing to FTE
reductions resulting from ongoing digitalisation.
Å Lower residential mortgage volumes, reflecting lower
origination as a result of our maintaining pricing discipline.
Operating results
(in millions) 2018 2017 Change
Net interest income 3,122 3,233 -3%
Net fee and commission income 365 338 8%
Other operating income 31 150 -80%
Operating income 3,517 3,721 -5%

Operating result 1,489 1,682 -11%
Impairment charges on financial instruments -12 -101 89%
Operating profit/(loss) before taxation 1,501 1,783 -16%
Income tax expense 375 454 -17%
Profit/(loss) for the period 1,126 1,329 -15%
Retail Banking’s profit decreased by 15%. This was driven
by lower impairment releases and lower operating income
as the figure for 2017 included net positive incidentals.
Net interest income decreased by 3% to EUR 3,122 million
(2017: EUR 3,233 million). If adjusted for incidentals in
both periods, the decrease was mainly attributable to the
combined impact (of approximately EUR 60 million) of the
model update for non-maturing deposits (NMD) and the
reallocation of net interest income from Group Functions.
Interest income from residential mortgages remained
stable as the lower average volume was offset by the
slight improvement in margins that resulted from good
pricing discipline in a highly competitive market. Interest
income on consumer loans declined as a result of lower
average volumes and margins. Deposit income continued
to be impacted by ongoing margin pressure in the low
interest rate environment.
Net fee and commission income increased by EUR 27 million
to EUR 365 million (2017: EUR 338 million), mainly due
to the increase in payment package fees in 2018.

Strategy and performance / Business performance / Retail Banking 23
Other operating income came out lower at EUR 31 million
(2017: EUR 150 million) as the figure for 2017 included
a book gain of EUR 114 million following the sale
of the remaining equity stake in Visa Inc.
Personnel expenses decreased by EUR 31 million in 2018
to EUR 442 million (2017: EUR 473 million). This was mainly
due to lower restructuring costs in 2018 (EUR 5 million
versus EUR 24 million in 2017) and declining FTE levels.
The decrease in the latter was partly offset, however,
by the new Collective Labour Agreement, which resulted
in salary increases of 2% and a one-off payment of
EUR 1,000 per employee. The decrease in the number
of FTE by 615 to 4,445 as at 31 December 2018 as a
result of digitalisation and cost-saving programmes is also
reflected in a further reduction in the number of branches.
Other expenses increased by EUR 20 million to
EUR 1,586 million (2017: EUR 1,566 million), mainly due
to the provision of EUR 30 million recorded in ICS for
additional costs to accelerate customer due diligence
(CDD) remediation programmes and to higher regulatory
levies (EUR 169 million, compared with EUR 155 million
in 2017). See note 29 Provisions of the Consolidated
Annual Financial Statements for further information.
The increase was partly offset by lower cost allocations
from Group Functions.
The operating result decreased by 11%. The cost/income ratio
increased to 57.7% in 2018 (2017: 54.8%), mainly due to
lower income.
Impairment charges amounted to a release of EUR 12 million,
compared with a release of EUR 101 million in 2017.
The impairment charges in 2017 benefited both from
favourable model updates and from additional IBNI
releases of EUR 60 million.

Business description
Commercial Banking is an established business partner
of the Dutch SME and corporate sector, with a selective
asset-based finance presence in the United Kingdom,
Germany, Belgium and France. We serve approximately
365,000 clients1
 with annual turnovers of up to
EUR 250 million across a wide variety of sectors.
Commercial Banking offers a broad range of products and
services based on in-depth client and sector knowledge.
Business developments
Introduction
The Commercial Banking team has continued its
journey of meeting changing client needs. Our strategy
is guided by client intimacy where it matters and efficiency
everywhere else. With our sector focus we aim to be
a valuable strategic partner for our clients, resulting in
strong and personal client relationships. We offer our
clients a wide range of innovative digital services to
meet their basic needs.
Supporting our clients’ transition to sustainability
We want to accelerate the sustainability shift of our
clients. We do this through new business propositions
and by leveraging on partners on topics such as energy
transition and circular transition. In 2018, we reopened
ABN AMRO Groenbank, a wholly owned subsidiary of
ABN AMRO that provides financing for sustainable
projects based on the Green Scheme established by
the Netherlands Enterprise Agency (RVO). In addition,
ABN AMRO now offers real estate owners a fast and
convenient way to check how their buildings measure
up to the requirements of the sustainability label
BREEAM-NL In-Use. BREEAM is an international
standard for assessing, improving and certifying the
sustainability performance of buildings. This quick scan,
developed in cooperation with CFP Green Buildings
and the Dutch Green Building Council, has been added
to ABN AMRO’s sustainable investment tools. Lastly,
as one of the founding partners of Social Finance NL,
a start-up issuing social impact bonds on the Dutch
financial market, ABN AMRO provides access to
finance for social entrepreneurs.
Reinventing the customer experience
We aim to provide services and products that improve
our clients’ businesses. We use the drivers of our
Net Promoter Score and continually engage with our
clients so that we can better understand their wishes
and challenges and can support them where needed.
As well as improving our current processes and offerings,
1 In January 2018, a group of approximately 300,000 small business clients were transferred from Retail to Commercial Banking.
Commercial Banking aims to innovate and to create
new partnerships. One example of such initiatives is
the strategic partnership that ABN AMRO has agreed
with Opportunity Network, an online cross-border
platform providing entrepreneurs with insight into real-life
opportunities for growth, acquisitions, expansion, sales
and so on. An example of our fee-based initiatives is
Tikkie, an app for payment requests. Commercial Banking
has also been expanding the opportunities for business
applications, including among the municipalities, universities
and other organisations that are already using Tikkie.
In 2018, our Net Promoter Score increased to -2 (2017: -6).
Building a future-proof bank
Commercial Banking has further improved its operational
efficiency by developing simple solutions and optimising
processes and documentation. SME prospects whose
current account overdraft requirement is less than
EUR 125,000 can now, for example, check whether
they are eligible for a loan without having to become an
ABN AMRO client first. Technological developments such
as blockchain can create opportunities for us to improve
our existing client propositions and develop new business
offerings. This is illustrated by the pilot we have launched
with the Port of Rotterdam and Samsung SDS, Samsung’s
logistics and IT division. The pilot aims to use blockchain
technology to build a platform for efficient and paperless
administration processes for international finance and
logistics relating to container transport. The platform should
make it just as easy to transport, track and finance goods
and services as it is to order a book online. ABN AMRO’s
wholly owned subsidiary New10 showed potential in
2018. New10 provides Dutch SMEs with loans ranging
between EUR 20,000 and EUR 1 million. With around 500
clients (approximately 60% of whom are not clients of
ABN AMRO), and a Net Promoter Score of more than 50,
New10 has proved that the digital model works for SMEs.
Our employee engagement score for 2018 came out at
77%, which is in line with 2017.
Financial review
Financial highlights
Å Net interest income supported by strong growth
of 4% in client lending and improved margins.
Å Higher operating expenses due to a provision of
EUR 55 million for additional costs to accelerate
CDD remediation programmes.
Å Elevated impairment charges reflect additions in
Industrial goods and services, Healthcare and Shipping,
with the remainder spread across various sectors.

Commercial Banking’s net profit was down 48% due
to higher impairments and costs.
Net interest income decreased by EUR 26 million to
EUR 1,602 million (2017: EUR 1,628 million) as the
figure for 2017 included a favourable incidental related
to a release of EUR 37 million for unearned interest.
Excluding this item, net interest income rose on the back
of continued growth in client lending across all sectors
and improved margins. This increase was partly offset
by the combined impact of the model update for NMD
and the reallocation of net interest income from Group
Functions, which negatively impacted on net interest
income in 2018 by approximately EUR 40 million.
Other operating income in 2018 totalled EUR 39 million
(2017: EUR 63 million) as the figure for 2017 benefited
from more favourable revaluation results.
Personnel expenses increased by EUR 7 million in 2018 to
EUR 335 million (2017: EUR 328 million). The increase was
driven by the higher restructuring provision in 2018 of
EUR 31 million (2017: EUR 12 million), the one-off payment
under the Collective Labour Agreement and salary increases,
but was largely offset by the decline in FTE numbers
resulting from well-executed cost-saving programmes.
Other expenses increased by EUR 47 million to
EUR 711 million (2017: EUR 664 million), largely due
to a provision of EUR 55 million for additional costs to
accelerate CDD remediation programmes (see note 29
Provisions of the Annual Financial Statements for further
information) and to higher regulatory levies (EUR 48 million
versus EUR 40 million in 2017). The increase was partly
offset by lower cost allocations from Group Functions.
The operating result decreased by 12%, while the C/I ratio
increased to 55.1%.
Impairments amounted to a charge of EUR 253 million,
compared with a net release of EUR 179 million in 2017,
mainly reflecting impairment charges in industrial goods
and services, healthcare and shipping. The remainder
was spread across various sectors. The release in 2017
was largely attributable to model refinements and
updates, compared with limited releases in 2018.

Strategy and performance
Business description
We are a leading private bank in Northwest Europe in
terms of client assets, with dedicated professionals who
have in-depth knowledge of their clients. This strength
allows us to continually adapt to changing client needs and
market developments, and to thoroughly understand the
financial situation of our clients. We offer clients multichannel wealth management services that enable them
to use our services whenever and wherever it suits them. 
We are an enterprising private bank aiming to have an
impact on society. We support and engage our clients by
offering forward-looking, expert advice enabling them to
manage their overall wealth in a risk-controlled manner
and taking both life and business events into account.
Private Banking targets high net worth individuals with
more than EUR 500,000 in investable assets in the
Netherlands or more than EUR 1 million outside the
Netherlands, and ultra-high net worth individuals with
more than EUR 25 million in investable assets.
Business developments
Introduction
In line with our ambition to continue to be a leading
Northwest European private bank, we took further steps
during the year to build our One Private Bank, including
investing in and further integrating our activities across
our core markets to achieve benefits of scale. Given that
the wealth management market is changing rapidly and
consolidating, scale is increasingly important if we are
to invest in the staff and systems needed to optimise
the services we provide to our clients. As we saw no
opportunities to achieve the scale required in Luxembourg
to optimally serve our clients we concluded that it would
be in their best interests to transfer our Luxembourgbased wealth management and insurance activities to
BGL BNP Paribas.
In July, we announced plans to acquire Société Générale’s
private banking subsidiary in Belgium. This acquisition fits
in perfectly with our strategy of consolidating our private
banking position in Northwest Europe. It will enable us
to serve our clients better and continue expanding our
Belgian activities. The acquisition was completed on
28 February 2019.
Supporting our clients’ transition to sustainability
To live up to our promise of ‘Banking for better, for
generations to come’ and to accelerate the sustainability
shift, we are taking responsibility for the impact that
our products and services have on society by offering
sustainable investment services. We choose our in-house
managed sustainable products and solutions by using
a combination of positive ESG (environmental, social
and governance) selection criteria. We actively engage
with companies that do not meet our criteria, while also
monitoring and seeking to improve their progress on
engagement objectives and evaluating their results.
If a company does not meet the objectives that have
been set, we may decide to end the relationship.
Our ambition is to achieve EUR 16 billion of sustainable
assets by 2020. By the end of 2018 we had achieved
EUR 13.9 billion in support of this transition. We are
also introducing internal key performance indicators (KPIs)
to monitor progress. We have designed an education
programme on sustainability, with over 500 people
participating in our online e-learning seminars on ESG and
sustainable investment. We have also signed an academic
partnership with Oxford University on sustainable
investment and asset management, and sponsor social
entrepreneurship chairs at the Erasmus University
Rotterdam and the University of Utrecht.
In the course of 2018, we started to offer the sustainable
investment option as the default option for new clients in
the Netherlands. The majority of new Discretionary
Portfolio Management (DPM) clients in the Netherlands
now chooses the sustainable investment option.
Reinventing the customer experience
Our strategy includes the ambition to offer our clients
open architecture solutions. ABN AMRO Investment
Solutions (AAIS) has accordingly completed the sale
of its direct investment business and can now focus on
offering a ‘pure’ open architecture and creating further
opportunities for growth across the private bank.
Throughout the year we continued working to deliver
products and services that fit our clients’ needs. In July,
we launched our customised advice service, which
provides ideas for strategic, tactical, thematic and
sustainable investments to experienced and committed
clients with assets under management of at least
EUR 2.5 million. In the Netherlands we introduced an
investment theme app in the second quarter of the year,
aimed at execution only clients. The themes covered in
this app include sustainable energy, sustainable investing,
connected world, healthcare technology, biotechnology,
emerging markets and water. To address the appetite for
alternative investments in portfolios, we launched our
Carlyle private equity product for clients in Germany,
France and the Netherlands. During the year we hosted
many events to update clients on developments in the
market. In Berlin, for example, we hosted a client event
for large investors interested in meeting start-ups and
incubators, while in the Netherlands we introduced video
banking so that we can have live discussions with clients
whenever and wherever they want.

Our efforts to deliver products and services fitting our
clients’ needs are being recognised in the market, as
exemplified by various awards, such as the WealthBriefing
Award for the best domestic clients team among private
banks in Europe. Nevertheless, our Net Promoter
Score went down to -1, which underpins the need to
continuously focus on clients’ demands and needs.
Building a future-proof bank
In 2017 we initiated organisation-wide functional management
in order to harmonise platforms, processes and product offerings across locations, to accelerate the introduction of digital
solutions, and to leverage knowledge and activities across
geographies. We have now completed the reorganisation
in the Netherlands and are making good progress in France
and Germany. While change naturally impacts on staff, we
have found that our strategy to harmonise, digitalise and grow
is resonating well with our employees. As a result, the annual
employee engagement score increased from 72% (2017)
to 75% (2018) across Private Banking, with client focus
and sustainability being seen as key strengths. The strategic
direction chosen by the bank to accelerate the sustainability
shift is also fully endorsed by Private Banking staff.
Financial review
Financial highlights
Å Excluding PB Asia results, net interest income rose
by 12% on the back of margin improvements, whereas
net fee and commission income decreased by 9%
owing to less favourable market sentiment.
Å Personnel expenses decreased owing to the FTE
reductions resulting from the PB Asia and Private
Banking Luxembourg divestments and restructuring
programmes.
Å Client assets decreased owing to a negative market
performance and some custody outflows.

Income tax expense 95 64 48%
Profit/(loss) for the period 312 386 -19%
Private Banking’s profit for 2018 amounted to
EUR 312 million (2017: EUR 386 million). Excluding
PB Asia results, profit increased by EUR 100 million
because of higher income resulting from favourable
incidentals (sale proceeds and provision releases from
divestments) and lower costs.
Net interest income rose by EUR 60 million to
EUR 719 million (2017: EUR 659 million). Excluding
the contribution of PB Asia, net interest income rose
by EUR 79 million. This increase was mainly due to
margin improvements, which were partly offset by
the combined impact of the NMD model update and
the reallocation of the net interest income with Group
Functions that negatively impacted on net interest
income by EUR 20 million. Net interest income in 2017
was negatively impacted by the Euribor provision of
EUR 10 million.
Net fee and commission income declined by EUR 64 million
to EUR 509 million (2017: EUR 573 million). Excluding the
contribution of PB Asia, net fee and commission income
decreased by EUR 49 million. Due to the volatility in the
financial markets, Private Banking clients were less active
in securities transactions, while more clients also opted
for execution only instead of managed portfolios. In
addition, the raised client threshold for advisory services
resulted in lower advisory volumes.
Other operating income decreased by EUR 195 million to
EUR 111 million (2017: EUR 307 million). Excluding the
sale proceeds of EUR 263 million (tax exempt) from the
PB Asia divestments in 2017, other operating income in
2018 rose by EUR 68 million. This was mainly the result
of positive incidentals of EUR 60 million relating to the
sale proceeds and provision releases from divestments
(the sale of Private Banking Luxembourg and asset
management activities in France).

Strategy and performance
Personnel expenses decreased by EUR 82 million to
EUR 390 million (2017: EUR 472 million). Excluding the
results of PB Asia in 2017, personnel expenses decreased
as a result of substantial FTE reductions, which were
partly offset by salary increases. FTE numbers decreased
by 445 compared with 2017, primarily due to the progress
made in the restructuring programmes and the divestment
of PB Luxembourg.
Other expenses amounted to EUR 539 million, compared
with EUR 624 million in 2017. Excluding the results of
PB Asia in 2017, other expenses decreased because of the
goodwill impairment of EUR 36 million included in 2017.
The operating result decreased by 7% year-on-year,
while the cost/income ratio improved slightly to 69.3%
(2017: 71.1%).
Impairment charges totalled EUR 3 million, compared with
a release of EUR 6 million in 2017. This was driven by
limited releases in 2018 and additions in the Netherlands.
Due to customers increased to EUR 66.2 billion
(2017: EUR 65.0 billion), mainly in the Netherlands.

Business description
Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB) has a client base
totalling more than 3,000. We have a strong market
position in the Netherlands, serving clients with revenues
in excess of EUR 250 million. We are leveraging the Dutch
franchise in four selected Northwest European countries
(France, Germany, United Kingdom and Belgium), where
we serve clients in a variety of sectors. Globally we focus
on three selected sectors and are present in 14 countries
or jurisdictions. CIB is sector-led and offers a wide range
of services and products in global markets and lending.
We have specialised activities in Clearing and Trade &
Commodity Finance.
Business developments
Introduction
In August 2018, CIB updated its strategic direction and
set a financial target of delivering >10% RoE in 20211.
The updated strategic direction has three main drivers.
These are to:
Å Reduce capital usage by EUR 5 billion RWA by 2020,
among lower-yielding and cyclical clients, as well as
in financing structures that are sensitive to higher
capital floors under Basel IV.
Å Save EUR 80 million in costs through FTE reductions
and IT rationalisation.
Å Transform into a capital-efficient business model
by centralising lending and coverage activities,
implementing central portfolio management, and
increasing our focus on distribution and on clients with
multiple product needs.
The strategic redirection of CIB is in line with the three
bank-wide strategic pillars of supporting our clients’
transition to sustainability, reinventing the customer
experience and building a future-proof bank.
Dutch banks – including ABN AMRO – have agreed
to compensate small business clients who were sold
interest rate derivatives in recent years, possibly
without sufficient advice. Payments follow an agreement
between the banks, the Netherlands Authority for the
Financial Markets and the government. ABN AMRO is
reassessing approximately 7,500 client files. Currently,
we’re finalising offers to the last few hundred clients
entitled to compensation under the agreement. Our aim
is to deliver offer letters to all eligible clients by the end
of the first quarter 2019. At present, we don’t expect
any adjustment to the provision we took in recent years
to cover compensation to clients.
1 Basel III RWAs and a CET1 target of 13.5%.
Supporting our clients’ transition to sustainability
We aim to create long-term value for and with our clients
and other stakeholders. We want to contribute to the
transition towards a sustainable economy that is Green
House Gas (GHG) emission-neutral and respectful of
human rights, and that protects our planet’s life, land
and water. We want to play a leading role in the transition
to a more sustainable world and help our customers in
their transition to more sustainable business models.
Our firm belief in ‘Banking for better’ is reflected in the
many initiatives we started in 2018, examples of which
include:
Å The launch of the Energy Transition Fund in May;
a EUR 200 million fund focusing on opportunities in
sustainable energy, energy efficiency/carbon reduction,
smart infrastructures and clean mobility.
Å Our seven sustainable sector plans with clear
objectives for the years to come.
Å The issue in April, of our third green bond. The green
assets underlying this bond are mortgage loans for
energy-efficient homes and financing for offshore
windfarm projects. 
Å The launching by ABN AMRO, ING and Rabobank of
joint circular economy finance guidelines designed
to provide better insight into financial backing for
the circular economy and help drive such financing. 
Å Being one of the leading banks developing responsible
ship recycling standards through our partnership in the
Sustainable Shipping Initiative.
Reinventing the customer experience
CIB’s business model is built on sustainable relationships
with multi-product clients. We use the drivers of our
Net Promoter Score, and we continually engage with
our clients in order to better understand their wishes
and challenges and to support them where needed.
Our Net Promoter Score in 2018 was 45 (2017: 32).
Technological developments such as blockchain are
creating opportunities for us to improve our existing client
propositions and to develop new business offerings.
In 2018, for example, we and 14 of the world’s largest
financing, trading and production institutions launched
komgo SA. This venture digitalises trade and commodities
finance processes through a blockchain-based open
platform and will transform the way these operations
are processed.

Strategy and performance
Building a future-proof bank
CIB has started transforming its business model in order
to drive capital efficiency under Basel IV. This means all
coverage and lending activities are being centralised to
focus more on multi-product clients and improve crossselling and lending efficiency. We will also centralise
portfolio management to maximise capital efficiency
through disciplined capital allocation, and centralise all
distribution activities to focus on higher capital velocity
by increasing fee income through distribution.
Together with our IT department, we will work on optimising
our systems to further improve operational efficiencies and
save costs. Operational efficiencies will be achieved through
the organisational optimisation of our Global Markets
department and through other measures, including the
phased closure of our UAE office and Moscow office.
We want to stimulate the personal development of our
employees so that, together, we can achieve our strategic
objectives and contribute to our purpose through an
optimal employee experience. Our employee engagement
score came out at 78%, which is in line with 2017.
Financial review
Financial highlights
Å Net interest income rose 20%, mainly on the back
of growth in client lending and the favourable impact
of new deals.
Å Other operating income benefited from favourable
Equity Participations results, partly offset by lower
CVA/DVA/FVA.
Å Operating expenses decreased as a result of lower
provisions for SME derivatives-related issues, partly
offset by higher restructuring provisions following
the CIB refocus.
Å Elevated impairment charges in 2018.

Income tax expense 75 121 -38%
Profit/(loss) for the period 426 221 93%
Corporate & Institutional Banking’s net profit increased
by EUR 205 million. The increase was driven by income
growth and cost reductions, partly offset by elevated
impairments.
Net interest income increased by EUR 191 million to
EUR 1,166 million (2017: EUR 975 million) owing to
the favourable impact of new deals and on the back
of increased client lending, although growth slowed
throughout 2018 as a result of the strategy refocus.
Deposit income was also higher as margins improved
modestly, offsetting lower deposit volumes. As well
as higher results in Global Markets and Clearing, the
increase included a positive amount of approximately
EUR 40 million representing the combined impact of the
updating of the model used for NMD and the reallocation
of net interest income from Group Functions.
Net fee and commission income decreased by EUR 11 million
to EUR 527 million (2017: EUR 538 million). The decrease
was mainly in Global Markets, which is volatile by nature,
and was partly offset by higher fees in Clearing as a result
of greater market volatility.
Other operating income came out at EUR 423 million (2017:
EUR 317 million). The increase was mainly attributable to
favourable Equity Participations results (EUR 274 million
versus EUR 114 million in 2017) and more favourable
revaluations in Clearing, and was partly offset by adverse
CVA/DVA/FVA results (EUR 2 million negative versus
EUR 75 million in 2017).
Personnel expenses amounted to EUR 480 million (2017:
EUR 442 million). The increase was driven by restructuring
provisions in 2018, mainly relating to the previously
announced strategy refocus and, to a lesser extent,
to salary rises.

Strategy and performance / Business performance / Corporate & Institutional Banking 31
Other expenses decreased by EUR 118 million to
EUR 708 million (2017: EUR 827 million), mainly due
to lower provisions for project costs relating to SME
derivatives-related issues (EUR 41 million versus
EUR 139 million in 2017) and higher regulatory levies
(EUR 86 million versus EUR 76 million in 2017).
The decrease was partly offset by lower cost
allocations from Group Functions.
Impairment charges amounted to EUR 427 million
(2017: EUR 219 million). The higher impairments were
mostly taken on existing impaired loans and primarily
in energy (mainly offshore), diamonds, shipping
and commodities.
Income tax expense decreased to EUR 75 million
(2017: EUR 121 million) as the figure for 2017 included
an impairment of deferred tax assets following a tax
reform in the United States.

Total client loans increased to EUR 42.6 billion
(2017: EUR 38.9 billion). Excluding the USD FX
appreciation impact of EUR 1.2 billion, client loans
increased by EUR 2.5 billion. The increase was mainly
in Corporates NL and Natural Resources and was partly
offset by a decrease in Trade and Commodity Finance,
including diamonds. The rate of growth slowed in 2018
as a result of the CIB refocus, which is expected to
gradually impact volumes throughout 2020.
Due to customers decreased to EUR 28.0 billion
(2017: EUR 30.3 billion). The decrease was mainly
reflected in corporates in the Netherlands and

Strategy and performance
Business description
Group Functions is organised into the following main
departments: Innovation & Technology, Finance, Risk
Management, Legal and Compliance, HR, Transformation
& Communications, Group Audit, Strategy & Sustainability
and the Corporate Office. The majority of Group
Functions’ costs are allocated to the businesses.
Innovation & Technology
Innovation & Technology supports the Group by facilitating
innovation, managing Group programs, and providing
services in the areas of IT, information security, data,
back-office processing, facilities management and
procurement, both in the Netherlands and internationally.
Finance
Finance helps keep the Group on track to achieve the
goals defined in its long-term strategy. It is the primary
supplier of management and reporting information to the
Group’s internal and external stakeholders, and plays an
independent role in delivering management information
and challenging business decisions. Finance provides
a strong financial control environment and ensures
compliance with accounting standards and requirements
set by the regulatory authorities. It consists of the
following main departments: Financial Accounting,
Controlling, Investor Relations, ALM, Treasury and Tax.
Risk Management, Legal and Compliance
A strong, sustainable bank is reliant on sound risk
management. Risk management secures a sound risk/
reward ratio by maintaining a bank-wide, moderate risk
profile as part of our long-term strategy. This risk profile is
managed on the basis of an integrated risk management
framework, in which all risk types, cross-risk types and
overarching risks are identified in order to provide a single,
integrated view of the risk profile of the bank and its
various businesses. Risk Management takes careful
account of this integrated risk profile and seeks to balance
actions so as to ensure the moderate risk profile is
maintained. The main risk types are credit, market,
liquidity, business and operational (non-financial) risks.
Underlying these main risk types are various sub-risk
types. Risk appetite statements are set both for the
main and the sub-risk types. The Risk, funding & capital
management section of this report elaborates on the
bank’s risk profile, risk taxonomy and risk appetite.
HR, Transformation & Communications
The primary responsibility of HR, Transformation and
Communications is to help the Group’s businesses
put clients centre stage by managing human resources
and the bank’s corporate identity and reputation. HR,
Transformation and Communications aims to prevent
reputational damage and to manage and improve the
Group’s reputation, brand name and brand value within
and outside the Netherlands in a consistent manner
and to position the Group as a trustworthy and
sustainable organisation. As part of this process,
ABN AMRO Foundation runs social projects and
coordinates activities that promote social engagement.
Group Audit, Strategy & Sustainability and
Corporate Office
Group Audit provides independent oversight and control,
on behalf of senior and executive management, of the
core processes, policies and procedures that are designed
to ensure that the Group complies with both the letter
and spirit of general and industry-specific legislation and
regulations. In this way, it helps to protect the Group’s
reputation. Strategy & Sustainability provides advice on
strategy and the implementation of various strategic
initiatives and activities, including acquisitions and
divestments, and strategic programmes for the Group
and its stakeholders. Additionally it formulates the Group’s
overall sustainability strategies and ensures that sustainable
banking is embedded in the Group’s business practices.
The Corporate Office is also part of Group Functions.
Financial review
Financial highlights
Å Operating income decreased by 8%, mainly due
to lower hedge accounting results and partly offset
by positive revaluations and incidentals.
Å Expenses directly incurred by Group Functions
decreased as a result of lower restructuring provisions
and the benefits of cost-saving programmes.

Net profit rose by EUR 17 million owing to lower costs,
which were partly offset by lower revenues.
Net interest income amounted to EUR 16 million negative
(2017: EUR 38 million negative). The figure for 2018
includes a provision release relating to securities financing
activities discontinued in 2009 (EUR 35 million). If adjusted
for this, the decrease was mainly attributable to a decline
in duration-related interest results, partly offset by the
positive impact of approximately EUR 80 million resulting
from the updating of the model used for non-maturing
deposits and the reallocation of net interest income to the
business segment, as well as higher mortgage penalty fees.
Net fee and commission income increased by EUR 12 million
to EUR 40 million (2017: EUR 28 million), partly due to the
increase in net fee and commission income from Stater
(mortgage service provider).
Other operating income decreased to EUR 196 million
(2017: EUR 248 million). This was due to less favourable
hedge accounting-related income, including the partial
sale of the public sector loan portfolio (EUR 79 million
versus EUR 181 million in 2017), and to the lower
provision release for securities financing activities
discontinued in 2009, and was partly offset by the
revaluation of equensWorldline (EUR 69 million).
Personnel expenses decreased by EUR 82 million to
EUR 794 million (2017: EUR 876 million), partly as a result
of lower restructuring provisions in 2018 (EUR 58 million
versus EUR 112 million in 2017). If adjusted for these
restructuring provisions, personnel expenses decreased
on the back of the lower average number of FTE in 2018,
partly offset by salary increases and the one-off payment
of EUR 1,000 per employee that was provided for in the
Collective Labour Agreement.
Other expenses amounted to EUR 635 million negative
(2017: EUR 689 million negative). This was due to lower
costs being allocated to commercial business lines and
was partly offset by lower expenses as the figure for 2017
included a EUR 17 million impairment charge related to
the ATM network.

section of the Annual Report contains information according to EU IFRS as well as
CRD IV/CRR, it provides more information on differences in scope and consolidation.
Contents
Risk, funding & capital management
This chapter sets out the Group’s approach to risk, funding
and capital management by describing strategy, policies,
governance and measurement approaches.
Risk, funding & capital review
Portfolio composition and movements are described in
the Risk, funding & capital review section. This section
also describes developments in the Group’s main types
of risk and regulatory capital.
Additional risk, funding & capital disclosures
This chapter provides additional disclosures required
under current regulations.
Regulatory requirements
The Risk, funding & capital section presents the
v1
disclosures required under the Dutch Financial Supervision
Act (Wet op financieel toezicht – Wft), the EU Capital
Requirements Regulation (CRR), Title 9 Book 2 of the
Dutch Civil Code, and EU IFRS. ABN AMRO also embraces
the Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF) principles
and recommendations.
Pillar 3 disclosures
The objective of Pillar 3 disclosures is to inform ABN AMRO’s
1
current and potential investors on how the organisation
manages risk and capital adequacy. Pillar 3 disclosures
are part of the Basel framework, which is based on
the three-pillar concept. Pillar 1 details the minimum
capital requirements, Pillar 2 relates to the internal capital
adequacy measurement and the supervisory review,
and Pillar 3 relates to disclosures on capital and risk
to encourage market discipline.
The Pillar 3 disclosures are prepared in accordance with
the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the EBA
guidelines. ABN AMRO has incorporated the qualitative
Pillar 3 disclosures into this Annual Report, along with
accompanying Investor Relations/Financial disclosures.
The quantitative Pillar 3 disclosures are published in a
separate document on the website of ABN AMRO Group N.V.
EU IFRS
Some disclosures in the Risk, funding & capital section
1
are an integral part of the Annual Financial Statements and
contain audited information. The audited parts concern risk
disclosures of financial instruments (IFRS 7) and capital
disclosures (IAS 1). Audited information in these sections
is labelled as ‘audited’ in the respective headings.
Enhanced Disclosure Task Force (EDTF)
ABN AMRO has implemented most of the 32
1
recommendations made by the Enhanced Disclosure Task
Force. These disclosures are labelled ‘EDTF’ in the
respective headings.
Risk exposure measurement and scope differences
v
Risk measures vary according to the purpose for which
exposure is calculated: EU IFRS or the determination of
regulatory or economic capital (CRD IV/CRR). EU IFRS is
mainly used to measure the bank’s financial results and
position. Regulatory and economic capital are more suitable
for certain risk measurement purposes because EU IFRS
classifies the financial position by class of product, whereas
the objective of regulatory reporting is to take a risk-sensitive
view on the bank’s portfolio and to ensure that sufficient
capital buffers for unexpected losses and sufficient liquidity
buffers are maintained. In addition, the financial position
according to EU IFRS provides a liquidity view instead
of a credit view.
EU IFRS reporting scope
The consolidation scope of ABN AMRO is determined in
1
accordance with IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements
and IFRS 11 Joint arrangements. More information can be
found in the Annual Financial Statements.
Regulatory reporting scope
The scope of consolidation for the purpose of calculating
v
regulatory and economic capital (based on the CRD IV and
CRR) is generally the same as the consolidation scope under
EU IFRS and includes subsidiaries which are directly or
indirectly controlled by ABN AMRO and active in the banking
and financial sectors. Subsidiaries consolidated under
EU IFRS but active in sectors other than banking and finance
are excluded from the regulatory scope of consolidation.

Risk, funding &
capital management
This section provides an overview of the Group’s approach to risk, funding and capital
management, including its strategies, measurement approaches and risk governance
framework. Portfolio developments are described in the Risk, funding & capital review section.
Risk approach
ABN AMRO is committed to being a well-capitalised
bank with sufficient liquidity that focuses on delivering
sustainable value to its stakeholders. We are committed
to maintaining a sound balance between risk and reward
as well as a bank-wide moderate risk profile as part of our
long-term strategy. We thoroughly evaluate the long-term
risk and return implications of our operations on an
ongoing basis.
Risk profile
ABN AMRO’s risk profile is managed by way of an
v27
integrated risk management framework, which identifies
all types of risk and cross-risk as well as overarching risks
in order to provide a single, integrated view on the risk
profile of the bank and its business lines. By taking an
integrated view of our risk profile, we strive to carefully
balance actions in order to manage the risk profile within
the moderate risk profile.
The following sections describe the risk taxonomy, risk
appetite, risk culture, risk governance and risk measurement,
all of which are key elements of our moderate risk profile.
For more information on the balance sheet composition,
please refer to the Risk, funding & capital review section.
Risk taxonomy
Our risk taxonomy classifies risks into risk types to
b7
which the bank is, or could be, exposed. It is reviewed
and updated on an annual basis to ensure that all material
risks are identified, defined and taken into account in
the risk governance framework. It creates a common risk
vocabulary, provides a checklist of types of risks for use
in risk assessments, and helps ensure that all material
risks are managed and that roles and responsibilities
are identified.
The main risk types are credit, market, liquidity, business
and operational (non-financial) risk. These main risk types
comprise various sub-risk types. Risk appetite statements
are set for both the main and sub-risk types. Reputational
risk and financial loss are considered factors that impact
the value of the bank.

Risk appetite
The risk appetite determines the level and nature of risk
bv27
that the bank is willing to take in order to pursue its
strategy.
The bank-wide risk appetite is an integral part of our
corporate strategy. Specific business-line risk appetites
further determine the bank-wide risk appetite. In addition,
risk appetites exist at a country and material entity level.
These risk appetites allow us to manage risk at every
appropriate level within the bank, as shown in the figure
to the right.

Risk, funding & capital / Risk, funding & capital management / Risk approach 39
The risk appetite follows the structure presented above.
The strategic Risk Appetite Statement (strategic RAS)
expresses ABN AMRO’s risk strategy of pursuing
a moderate risk profile and cascades into the risk
indicator framework at various levels of the organisation:
bank-wide (BRAS), business line (BLRAS), local (LRAS)
and entity level (ERAS). The strategic RAS is approved
by the Executive Board and Supervisory Board.
Senior management monitors the bank’s activities,
based on the risk appetite. The status of adherence to the
risk appetite, and its outlook, are discussed on a monthly
basis in the Executive Board and on a quarterly basis
by the Supervisory Board, based on the Enterprise
Risk Management report. The cascaded risk appetites
(BLRAS, LRAS, ERAS) are monitored based on their
respective reports, and discussed and approved at their
respective levels.
The elements of the strategic RAS ensure a coherent
balance between return and value creation, our business
model, capital and liquidity & funding, taking into account
the conduct, governance and control framework shown in
the figure below. For each element, key qualitative and/or
quantitative statements are set.

Sustainable

Capital

&
Funding
The statements in the strategic RAS are cascaded into
an underlying risk indicator framework at bank, business
lines, entity and country levels. This risk indicator framework
consists of statements set for each main and sub-risk type
presented in the risk taxonomy. Each statement consists
of one or more quantitative and/or qualitative indicators,
referred to as key risk indicators (KRI). For every KRI,
a limit is set against which the actual risk profile is
monitored. If the limit of a KRI is breached, action is
required to bring our risk profile back within the limit.
To allow for timely action, early warnings are in place
to prevent breaches.
Examples of KRIs in our risk appetite include:
Å Regulatory and internal capital ratios
Å Risk-adjusted return measures
Å Concentration limits for single counterparties,
industry sectors and countries
Å Economic capital and risk-weighted asset limits
for various risk types
Å Liquidity ratios (LtD, LCR, NSFR)
Å Market risk parameters (duration, NII-at-Risk)
Å Operational risk parameters (outstanding issues)
Å Reputational parameters (NPS, employee
engagement score)
When setting the statement for each risk type, the
following aspects are considered in view of the corporate
strategy, market standards (such as peer analyses),
the economic environment, regulations, the views of
our stakeholders and the actual risk profile, as well as
internal insights and risk management tools. In addition
to incorporating these views, balancing these aspects
provides us with the means to substantiate risk
statements for each risk type.
Risk culture
The bank has a continuous focus on risk awareness as
v6
an integral part of its bank-wide risk culture. Pursuing
a moderate risk profile is embedded in the risk culture
by means of communication and training and is monitored
through performance management.
Employees are expected to be aware of the drivers of our
risk profile and to feel accountable for the risks they take.
Part of the awareness programme is the Integrated Risk
Management course, which emphasises the importance
of taking a holistic view of risks. To continually reinforce
bank-wide awareness of non-financial risks, a permanent
education tool and training app are used, while more
specific training is also available for each business line
and for specific roles or functions. Employees are also
expected to adhere to the ABN AMRO culture principles
and to act in accordance with the code of conduct. These
are fundamental to everything we do and describe how
we act as a bank, how we make decisions, and how we
deal with various dilemmas. The code of conduct is
published on our website.

We place a strong emphasis on sound risk control in our
compensation policies. ABN AMRO’s remuneration policy
is in line with our risk profile. More details are provided
in the Remuneration paragraph in the Leadership &
governance chapter.
Risk governance
The Risk Governance Charter defines ABN AMRO’s Risk
bv5
governance and decision framework (delegated authorities
and mandates) for both financial and non-financial risk. The
Risk Governance Charter is in place to support an efficient
and effective Risk Control Management throughout, and
at all levels of, the bank. The Risk Governance charter
supports the Bank in being compliant with the Basel
Committee of Banking Supervisors (BCBS) guidance
‘Corporate Governance Principles for Banks’ and the
‘EBA guidelines on Internal Governance’.
The Risk Management organisation operates under the
direct responsibility of the Chief Risk Officer, who is a
member of the Executive Board. The Executive Board has
overall responsibility for the risks that ABN AMRO takes.
Three lines of defence 
The three lines of defence principle provides a clear
division of activities and responsibilities in risk management
at different levels in the bank and at different stages in
the lifecycle of risk exposures. The three lines of defence
principle is summarised in the following figure:
Three lines of defencebv5
Executive risk committees
In the risk decision-making framework, the Executive
Board is supported by three executive risk committees:
the Group Risk Committee, Group Central Credit Committee
and Group Asset & Liability Committee, each of which is
jointly chaired by a member of the Executive Board. The
two other executive committees are the Group Regulatory
Committee and the Group Disclosure Committee.
The Executive Board is ultimately responsible for a
balanced assessment of the bank’s commercial interests
and the risks to be taken within the boundaries of the risk
appetite. In addition to the risk committees, the Executive
Board itself makes decisions that are of material significance
for the risk profile, capital allocation and liquidity of
ABN AMRO. The terms and conditions of the committees
are specified in the Risk Governance Charter.
Group Risk Committee
The Group Risk Committee (GRC) is mandated by the
Executive Board to monitor, assess and manage the
bank’s risk profile in relation to the risk appetite. The GRC
is, for example, responsible for establishing a product
approval process to ensure we only accept risks that
we understand and that serve the interests of clients,
and for ensuring the adequate functioning of this process.
The GRC has delegated specific approval powers to
subsidiary risk committees, but remains responsible
on behalf of the Executive Board.
Group Central Credit Committee
The Group Central Credit Committee (CCC) is mandated
by the Executive Board to decide on the acceptance of
counterparty risk in respect of individual persons, legal
entities and public administrative bodies relating to credit
proposals. In certain cases, for example above a specific
threshold, the CCC’s decisions require final approval
by the Executive Board.

mandated by the Executive Board to decide on the
capital adequacy, the liquidity risk profile, the market risk
in the banking book and the funds transfer pricing of
the organisation and its subsidiaries, within the policies
and limits approved by the GRC.
More information about Governance in general and the
Group Regulatory Committee and the Group Disclosure
Committee is provided in the Leadership & governance
chapter.
Risk measurement
We develop and use internal models to quantify the risk
v25
for most risk types in the risk taxonomy. The models for
credit, operational, market, liquidity and business risk are
the most widely used and allow for measuring the level
of risk. They support day-to-day decision-making, as well
as periodic monitoring and reporting on developments in
the bank’s portfolios and activities. In most cases, models
quantify the probability and severity of an event, i.e. the
likelihood that an event will occur and the loss the bank
may suffer as a consequence of that event. This information
serves as the basis for ABN AMRO’s internal measures
of risk (economic capital) and as key input for calculating
the minimum regulatory capital requirements according
to the Basel framework (regulatory capital).
New models require formal internal and external approval
before being implemented and used. Internal approval for
the use (or continued use) of a model is obtained from the
Methodology Acceptance Group (MAG), a sub-committee
of the Group Risk Committee. When required, external
approval is obtained from the regulator.
The modelling departments develop models in close
cooperation with the relevant business and risk experts.
In principle, we review models annually. This means
that we back-test the models against historical data and,
where relevant, benchmark calibration of the models with
external studies. When model performance degrades, or
when degradation is suspected, risk management can
impose capital add-ons to the models. These add-ons are
calculated by a comprehensive framework covering both
inherent weaknesses in the models and weaknesses in
the model processes such as delays in reviews.
The independent Model Validation Department validates
all internal models. Validation guidelines ensure objectivity,
consistency, transparency and continuity. Models are
validated according to these principles and reviewed
against internal and regulatory requirements.
Capital
Regulatory capital (CRD IV/CRR)
Under the Basel framework as implemented in European
bv
legislation (CRD IV and CRR), banks are required to hold
capital to cover financial risks. Banks determine the level
of risks for the three major risk types (credit, operational
and market risk) in terms of aggregated risk weighted
assets (RWA). The capital requirements are stated as
a percentage of RWA. Under Pillar 1, banks are required
to hold a regulatory fixed percentage of RWA in capital.
Under Pillar 2, supervisors impose an additional – bank
specific – percentage of RWA in addition to the Pillar 1
requirement. The so-called capital buffers are a requirement
in addition to Pillar 1 and 2, also defined as percentages
of RWA. The capital buffer requirements are a mixture
of percentages prescribed by law and percentages set
by various regulators.
Economic capital
In addition to regulatory required capital, for Pillar 2, we
calculate economic capital (EC). Economic capital covers
all risk types in our risk taxonomy for which capital
is deemed to be the mitigating instrument to cover
unexpected losses, and is used as the key metric for
internal risk measurement and management. It is the
amount of capital we reserve in order to achieve a
sufficient level of protection against large unexpected
losses that could result from extreme market conditions
or events.
Internal models are used to calculate EC at a 99.95%
confidence level and a one-year time horizon. This implies
that the estimated capital figure for the coming year is
sufficient to cover a level of loss that will be exceeded
in only 0.05% of all possible cases.
EC is aggregated for all risk types to determine the total
EC at bank level and to support capital allocation, ex-post
performance measurement and risk-appetite setting such
as industry concentration risk limits. EC is also used at a
transactional level in loan-pricing tools. These tools act as a
decision-making mechanism for assessing the profitability
of a new or existing transaction in terms of the risk-adjusted
return on risk-adjusted capital (RARORAC).

Risk, funding & capital / Risk, funding & capital management / Risk approach
EC Quality Assessment
The EC models described above form the core of the
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP).
In order to monitor and secure the quality of the EC
framework and its outcome in terms of capital adequacy,
an EC Quality Assessment (ECQA) is performed yearly as
part of the ICAAP. For each main risk type, the calculated
EC figure is evaluated in the following areas:
Å Risk coverage;
Å Responsiveness to internal and external developments;
Å Data quality;
Å Compliance with EC policy;
Å Validity of choices and assumptions.
If considered necessary, an additional capital buffer
(‘EC add-on’) is taken to cover any identified shortfalls
in the EC.
Stress testing and scenario analysis
ABN AMRO uses stress testing and scenario analysis
bv8
as an important risk management instrument, looking
at profitability, capital and liquidity risk from a bank-wide
perspective on a regular basis. In addition, sub-portfolio
and risk type-specific stress testing and scenario analysis
are executed.
Stress testing purposes
ABN AMRO applies stress test and scenario analysis
for several purposes, including:
Å Risk-appetite setting and monitoring: the outcome
of stress testing is used for setting and monitoring
risk appetite limits and targets, including limits under
stress. If the stress test outcome breaches a limit,
mitigating actions will be considered to close the
shortfall. The impact is taken into account in the capital
and funding planning;
Å Contingency planning: stress testing is used to
assess and strengthen the contingency plans’ triggers
and measures. To this end, reverse stress testing is
executed to gain advanced insight into plausible events
that could put the continuity of ABN AMRO under
pressure;
Å Capital planning: stress testing is used to gain insight
into the resilience of our capital under adverse changes
in the economic environment and ABN AMRO specific
circumstances. The results of the stress tests are
incorporated into the capital plan;
Å Supervisory stress testing based on prescribed
scenarios and assumptions. This includes EBA’s stress
test programme, to assess the resilience of banks
to adverse economic or financial developments.
The figure below shows the stress test and scenario
analysis cycle.

Stress test & scenario analysis cycle
The stress test and scenario analysis cycle starts with
the identification of material risks for ABN AMRO
and individual business lines. Both systemic risks (e.g.
macroeconomic risks) and ABN AMRO-specific risks
(e.g. cyber attack or adverse outcomes in legal procedures)
are considered. Also, sensitivity analysis is used to gain
insight into key vulnerabilities. Based on the risk identification,
scenarios are defined. Alongside most likely scenarios,
we also define severe, but plausible scenarios. Scenarios
can have a short-term horizon, e.g. an instant market
shock, or a long-term horizon, e.g. a multi-year recession.
Scenario projections are based on quantitative models
as well as expert opinion procedures. In general, results
are presented excluding and including potential mitigating
actions, taking into account contingency plans. Two types
of management actions can be distinguished in the stress
test and scenario analysis: i) direct actions based on
the scenario exercise and ii) actions that would be taken
if the scenario were to materialise.
Given the importance of stress testing in terms of sound
risk management, the Executive Committee is involved
throughout the process and its governance. The Executive
Committee, together with the Scenario & Stress Test
Committee (a sub-committee of the Group Risk Committee),
discusses and decides on the scenario selection, the
results and the implications.

Risk, funding & capital / Risk, funding & capital management / Credit risk management 43
Credit risk is the risk that the value and/or the earnings
of the bank decline due to uncertainty in a counterparty’s
ability or willingness to repay a loan or meet the terms
of a contractual obligation.
Credit risk management is the responsibility of the first
and second lines of defence. The primary responsibility
for intake, managing and monitoring credit risk lies with
the business as the first line of defence. The second line
of defence has a permanent and ongoing responsibility
to define the boundaries and monitor whether the type
and level of credit risk exposures are within the limits of
the business lines’ risk appetite. Credit risk management
within the bank is governed by the bank-wide central
credit risk policy and further detailed in underlying specific
credit risk policies.
Credit risk management approach
ABN AMRO employs two separate approaches to
bv
managing credit risk, which reflects the bank’s way of
doing business. For customised lending to counterparties
(Non-Programme Lending), risks are assessed on an
individual basis. Standardised products and processes
are managed on a pooled basis (Programme Lending)
to which uniform risk criteria are assigned. Effectively,
any lending not defined as Programme Lending is defined
as Non-Programme Lending. 
The process of credit risk management is illustrated
in the following figure:

Risk, funding & capital
Risk, funding & capital / Risk, funding & capital management / Credit risk management
Planning
Within Programme Lending, the credit cycle starts with
a product planning phase, during which the product is
designed and/or reviewed, with the goal of optimising
its key drivers of risk and return within the context of
ABN AMRO’s strategy, risk appetite, the client’s best
interest and sustainability.
Credit acceptance
Within Non-Programme Lending, the credit acceptance
phase of a credit proposal starts with an assessment of
the proposal by the relevant business line and by Risk
Management. The qualitative and quantitative details of
the credit risk associated with the loan must be assessed
prior to approval. Information must be provided on matters
such as the purpose, details and structure of the proposed
credit facility, the borrower and other counterparties, the
industry and geography, management and owners, and
financial and non-financial analyses. The credit decision is
based on independent assessments of both the commercial
and the credit risk function.
For a credit approval decision within Programme Lending,
client-specific aspects and internal/external data are taken
into consideration to calculate a credit score (scorecard).
The credit decision is based on the outcome of the
scorecard and policy rules.
Credit risk monitoring
Consistent and regular monitoring helps to safeguard the
bank’s position in relation to all risks associated with the
counterparty, credit type or portfolio. Monitoring starts
when the credit facility has been provided and continues
throughout the lifecycle of the credit facility and the
relationship with the counterparty until the exposure is
repaid and/or the limit is cancelled.
Should a situation arise in which an individual counterparty
shows signs of credit risk deterioration, but is not in
default, a ‘watch’ status is assigned. A ‘watch’ status
indicates that a counterparty requires close monitoring
and appropriate follow-up measures in order to prevent
a default. Indicators for the ‘watch’ status are: changes
in risk profile, liquidity problems, management issues,
market outlook, potential breach of credit agreement,
solvency issues and uncertain continuity.
Restructuring & Recovery
Credit facilities that are subject to a default event are
mandatorily transferred to the Financial Restructuring &
Recovery department (FR&R). Credit facilities with an
identified significantly high risk can be transferred to the
FR&R if specialised restructuring knowledge is required.
If a ‘going concern’ approach is applicable and return to
a performing status is considered likely, the credit facility
is transferred to the Restructuring team, which devises
a plan aimed either at rehabilitation or at enhancing the
likelihood of full repayment. In all other cases, the credit
facility is transferred to the Recovery team.
Programme Lending contracts are transferred to the
Restructuring team when a default status is assigned
because payments have been past due for more than
90 days or because another default trigger applies.
If restructuring is ultimately not effective, the client
is transferred to other internal departments or external
parties (such as Intrum) for debt collection.
Once a client is considered to be able to meet its future
payment obligations and the involvement of FR&R
is no longer required, the client is transferred back
to the business.
Credit risk measurement
We use internal models to measure the credit risk
bv2
associated with exposures to individual clients and
portfolios. To estimate the expected losses for all type
of exposure classes, these models quantify the clients’
Probability of Default (PD), Exposure at Default (EAD)
and Loss Given Default (LGD).
The models vary from purely statistical to expert-based
and employ quantitative as well as qualitative risk drivers.
Using input values for the risk drivers, the models
calculate PDs, EADs and LGDs. EAD is established
on a monthly basis, using actual limits and outstanding
exposure data. PD and LGD are determined at least
annually.
The models’ estimates are embedded in the credit
approval and internal reporting processes in order to
calculate economic capital and the minimum regulatory
capital requirements under the Basel Advanced Internal
Ratings Based (AIRB) approach. They also serve as input
for the RARORAC (Risk Adjusted Return on Risk Adjusted
Capital), the bank’s key metric for risk-adjusted performance.
The growing use of data-analysis and modelling in
all of the bank’s processes requires a stronger model
management framework. Historical data needs to be
enhanced to support the primary business processes
and the regulatory reporting processes. In addition
to the growing demand for analysis and modelling,
regulatory expectations have also increased, requiring
higher standards and a broader control framework
for our models.

Probability of Default
The probability of default (PD) indicates the likelihood that
a counterparty will default within a one-year time horizon.
For the non-programme lending portfolio, the PD, as a
percentage, maps to and is expressed as an internal
uniform counterparty rating (UCR), ranging from 1 to 8.
For Programme Lending portfolios within Retail Banking and
Commercial Banking, products with the same characteristics
are pooled and a PD is assigned to each pool.
In line with regulatory guidance, we define a default to
have occurred when:
Å the counterparty is overdue by more than 90 days; or
Å the bank considers the borrower to be unlikely to meet
its contractual obligations;
Å besides mandatory triggers, judgemental triggers
also apply.
ABN AMRO uses rating systems, which are developed
and used in accordance with the CRR. According to
the three lines of defence model, the use of the rating
systems is separated from the development and validation
of these systems. The independent Credit Risk Control
Unit oversees the proper use of the systems and reports
on the coverage of the use of appropriate reporting
models. The Validation department independently checks
the accuracy of all credit rating systems. Our internal
rating scale corresponds with the equivalent classifications
of the rating agencies.

Exposure at Default
Exposure at Default (EaD) models estimate the expected
exposure at the time a counterparty defaults. If all or part
of a facility is undrawn (i.e. the outstanding amount is less
than the approved limit) at the time of the EaD calculation,
a portion of the undrawn amount is added to the exposure
to reflect the observation that counterparties draw larger
portions of their approved facilities when nearing default.
Loss Given Default
Loss Given Default (LGD) models estimate the amount of
money the bank will lose if the counterparty defaults. It is
expressed as a percentage of the outstanding amount at
default. Typically an LGD will never be 100% as the bank
uses mitigating techniques, such as securing collateral,
to minimise losses in the event of default. The LGD is
thus the portion of the exposure at default that is left
after realisation of secured collateral. Other factors,
such as the facility seniority, will also affect the LGD rate.
Capital for credit risk
Regulatory capital
Capital requirements for credit risk are determined by
calculating all top-level exposure classes in accordance
with the Advanced Internal Rating Based Approach (AIRB).
Within these exposure classes, a number of smaller
portfolios are temporarily or permanently calculated
according to the Standardised Approach (SA). ABN AMRO
has been granted approval to apply the AIRB, including a
number of exemptions, by the relevant competent authority.
Economic capital
The EC model for credit risk uses a Monte Carlo
simulation to determine a full portfolio loss distribution,
taking into account specific portfolio characteristics and
diversification effects. Loan facilities are valued on an
economic value (mark-to-market) basis to ensure that loss
estimates can be based not only on defaulting borrowers,
but also on possible credit migrations and changes
associated with the market values of loans.

Specific counterparty credit risk
Specific calculation methodologies are applied to determine
v2l
counterparty credit exposure relating to over-the-counter
(OTC) derivative instruments and securities financing.
OTC derivative instruments
OTC derivatives are financial instruments which are
used to cover current and/or future financial risks or to
achieve additional return on an investment. They consist
of transactions concluded between two parties and of
which the value is based on an underlying base value
(e.g. interest rates, foreign exchange rates, commodities,
equities).
Securities financing transactions
The balance sheet item Securities financing refers to
securities lending, a market activity whereby securities
are temporarily transferred from a lender to a borrower,
subject to the commitment to re-deliver the securities,
usually in the short term. The borrower collateralises
the transaction with cash or other securities of equal
or greater value than the borrowed securities in order
to protect the lender against counterparty credit risk.
As an intermediary between clients and the market,
we act both as lender and borrower.
Regulatory and economic exposure calculation
for specific counterparty credit risk
The regulatory calculation methodology applied for
calculation of the counterparty credit risk exposure
value (EAD) of OTC derivative instruments is the markto-market method.
The economic counterparty credit risk exposure
calculation of OTC derivative instruments is based on
the mark-to-market (MtM, i.e. current exposure) plus
an add-on for potential future exposure. The add-on is
calculated to cover 95% of the potential positive MtM
movement in favour of the bank for the entire deal tenor.
The add-on is determined by several parameters, such
as the type of derivative product (underlying), deal tenor,
currency (pair) and the absence or presence of netting
and collateral agreements.
For securities lending, the Financial Collateral Comprehensive
Method (FCCM) is used in the regulatory calculations.
For economic counterparty exposure calculations,
the FCCM is applied with additional conservatism.
Wrong-way risk
This risk refers to transactions whose counterparty
credit exposure arising from OTC or Securities Lending
transactions is positively correlated to the counterparty’s
probability of default. In other words, the credit exposure
increases when the credit quality of the counterparty
deteriorates. In general, we do not engage in such wrongway risk transactions. We are also prudent in considering
transactions in which this correlation is less obvious, e.g.
transactions where a general wrong-way risk component
forms part of the deal, or where a counterparty and the
underlying issuer are in a similar industry, or in the same
country or geographical region.
Credit concentration risk
Credit concentration risk is the risk of loss arising from
bv
large exposures, as related to the total risk exposure of
the bank, to a single counterparty or to counterparties that
are positively and highly correlated. Positively correlated
counterparties are counterparties of which the credit
quality will move in the same direction under similar
circumstances. Limiting excessive concentrations is
fundamental to our credit risk strategy, which is why we
aim to keep the credit risk portfolio sufficiently granular
and diversified.
To avoid excessive credit risk concentrations, Risk
Management sets maximum levels for subgroups
in the following categories:
Å Single counterparty and groups of related
counterparties (counterparty concentration);
Å Countries (geographic concentration);
Å Industry sectors (industry concentration).
Counterparty concentration
Counterparty concentration credit risk is the risk of loss
arising from relatively large exposures to counterparties
belonging to the same risk group. The One Obligor
Exposure (OOE) is the exposure to a risk group, including
all drawn and undrawn facilities granted plus all indirect
exposure to the risk group, including guarantees and any
other recourse claims. A risk group is an interrelated group
of counterparties with a high degree of dependency on
each other due to a control relationship. This control
relationship may be due to direct or indirect majority
interests being held by the same shareholder or group
of shareholders. Counterparty credit concentration risk
is measured by the OOE and the Economic Capital (EC)
per counterparty. The bank limits its counterparty credit
risk by setting OOE and EC limits. Additionally, all credit
applications with an OOE and/or EC above a certain
threshold are reviewed by the Executive Board.
Geographic concentration
ABN AMRO has branches and subsidiaries located
outside the Netherlands, as well as clients who operate
internationally. Consequently the bank is exposed to
country risk, which is the risk of credit losses arising from
country-specific events or circumstances. Management
of country risk focuses on cross-border risk, which
includes the risk that funds, goods or services cannot be
transferred out of a country as a result of actions by local
authorities or because of other events impeding the
transfer. These risks are managed by setting country credit
limits, based on individual country analyses by economic, 
ABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018
Introduction Strategy and performance Risk, funding & capital Leadership Governance Annual Financial Statements Other
Risk, funding & capital / Risk, funding & capital management / Credit risk management 47
compliance and country risk experts. Country limits are
reviewed at least once a year. Each country also has an
internal credit rating, which is reviewed and approved
twice a year and is an important factor in managing
country concentration risks.
Industry concentration
Industry concentration risk is the risk of loss arising from
a relatively large credit exposure to counterparties active
in a single industry. Industry concentration risk arises
when deterioration in a specific industry has an effect on
all credit exposures relating to that industry. ABN AMRO
manages its industry concentrations by setting credit risk
economic capital (EC) limits as a percentage of total
credit risk EC per industry. In addition to the EC limits,
EC concentration checkpoints are set to facilitate timely
and sufficient management interventions to avoid breaching
of the limits.
Credit risk mitigation
Credit risk mitigation techniques are used by the bank to
vz
reduce the credit risk associated with the bank’s credit
exposures. Such techniques relate mainly to collateral
management and guarantees, offsetting financial assets
and liabilities, and enforcing master netting agreements
or similar instruments.
Credit risk mitigation techniques themselves entail risks
and as such they need to meet certain requirements to
ensure they are used effectively and in line with the bank’s
risk appetite. ABN AMRO has therefore established
mandatory bank-wide policies governing the use and
management of credit risk mitigation techniques, which
are in line with regulatory requirements as well as the
needs of the bank and its clients. These bank-wide policies
set out the overarching rules that must be observed by
business specific procedures and processes related to
credit risk mitigation.
Collateral management and guarantees
Collateral represents assets with material value that
have been received by (or pledged to) the bank to secure
obligations under a credit facility or other exposure.
To be effective, such security needs to give the bank the
right to appropriate and liquidate collateral on time and
without impediments so that losses on the exposure at
default are minimised.
In addition to its ability to minimise exposure risk, eligible
collateral can also reduce the regulatory and economic
capital the bank is required to hold as a buffer for
unexpected losses. The Capital Requirements Regulation
prescribes the criteria that collateral must meet to
become eligible for capital reduction. These criteria, which
provide for legal effectiveness and enforceability, valuation
and monitoring of collateral, aim at the effective and timely
realisation of collateral.
We also use guarantees to mitigate exposure risks. These
include guarantees from, for example, banks, governments
and export credit agencies. The credit quality of guarantors
is assessed at origination and monitored to ensure the
guarantee is valued correctly for risk mitigation purposes.
Offsetting financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net
amount is reported on the EU IFRS balance sheet if there
is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised
amounts and there is either an intention to settle on a net
basis or an intention to realise the asset and settle the
liability simultaneously. The bank applies netting to debtor
and creditor balances, such as current accounts, where
offsetting is justified by formal agreement with the client,
provided they meet the applicable criteria.
Enforceable master netting agreements
or similar instruments
Enforceable master netting arrangements take into
account all agreements with conditions that make
offsetting exercisable in the event of default. In addition,
agreements are enforceable if the bank has a legally
enforceable right to offset and does not have any ability
and/or intention to realise the asset and settle the liability
simultaneously. These arrangements include derivative
clearing agreements, global master repurchase agreements
and global master securities lending agreements.
Forborne, past due and credit loss allowances
bvj
Loans at risk are primarily exposures for which there
are signs indicating that the counterparty may become
credit impaired in the future. Loans at risk are classified
into different risk categories for individual counterparties
and days-in-arrears buckets for groups of aggregated
counterparties in order to optimise monitoring and review
of these loans.
Forbearance
Forbearance is the process of making concessions to
b
clients who are or will soon be experiencing financial
difficulty, with the intention of bringing them back within
their payment capacity. A forborne asset is any contract
which has been entered into with a counterparty who is
in or about to face financial difficulty, and which has been
refinanced or modified on terms and conditions that we
would not have accepted (concession) if the counterparty
had been financially healthy.
Forbearance measures can be applied to contracts on
which the counterparty has already defaulted, as well
as to contracts that are still performing.

Risk, funding & capital
Risk, funding & capital / Risk, funding & capital management / Credit risk management
A forborne contract will cease to qualify as forborne
only when all the following conditions are met:
The contract is considered performing;
Å A minimum probation period of two years has passed
from the date the forborne contract was considered
performing;
Å Regular payments of more than an insignificant amount
of principal or interest have been made during at least
half of the probation period;
Å The counterparty does not have any contract, within
the credit agreement, which is more than 30 days past
due at the end of the probation period.
If the forborne contract is or has become non-performing
at the time of the forbearance measure, a mandatory cure
period of at least one year applies to the contract before
it is returned to a performing status. The cure period starts
when the contract becomes non-performing or, if the contract
was already non-performing, from the moment the last
forbearance measure was taken. More information about
non-performing can be found at the end of this section.
Past due credit exposures
A financial asset is past due if a counterparty fails to make
bv
a payment on the contractual due date or if the counterparty
has exceeded an agreed limit. ABN AMRO starts counting
days past due from the first day that a counterparty is past
due on any financial obligation.
Accounting policy on measurement of allowances
for credit losses
Since 1 January 2018, ABN AMRO has recognised loss
bvj
allowances based on the expected credit loss model
(ECL) of IFRS 9, which is designed to be forwardlooking. The IFRS 9 impairment requirements are
applicable to financial assets measured at amortised
cost or fair value through other comprehensive income
(FVOCI), loan commitments and financial guarantee
contracts. These financial instruments are divided into
three groups, depending on the stage of credit quality
deterioration:
Recognition of ECL
Interest revenue
Effective interest on gross carrying amount Effective interest on gross carrying amount Effective interest on amortised cost
(gross carrying amount less loss allowance)
12 month ECL Lifetime ECL Lifetime ECL
Performing
(Initial recognition)
Credit risk deteriorated
(Assets with significant increase in
credit risk since initial recognition)
Default = Impaired
(Credit impaired assets)
Stage 1 Stage 2 Stage 3
Change in credit quality since initial recognition
Stage triggers
We use quantitative and qualitative stage triggers to
determine whether a financial instrument should be
classified as stage 1 or stage 2.
Quantitative stage trigger
The key quantitative metric determining when a
financial instrument is transferred from stage 1 to
stage 2 is the deterioration of the lifetime probability
of default (LPD) from the date of origination to the
reporting date, based on internal data. The LPD
represents the likelihood that a counterparty will
default during the lifetime of the financial instrument
and depends on credit risk drivers such as:
Å product characteristics (e.g. repayment and interest
terms, term of the product)
Å financial condition of the borrower
Å number of days past due
Å the geographical region
Å future developments in the economy.
ABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018
Introduction Strategy and performance Risk, funding & capital Leadership Governance Annual Financial Statements Other
Risk, funding & capital / Risk, funding & capital management / Credit risk management 49
If the LPD deterioration of a counterparty is above
a modelled portfolio threshold, the counterparty is
transferred from stage 1 to stage 2. Due to limitations
in the availability of historical data, ABN AMRO
currently uses a 12-month PD proxy for LPD, as we
consider this appropriately representative for the LPD.
Qualitative stage triggers
The bank transfers a financial instrument from stage 1
to stage 2 if the instrument meets one of the following
qualitative triggers:
Å Forborne status of a borrower;
Å Watch status of a borrower. ABN AMRO assigns
the watch status to individual counterparties with
Å an increased credit risk. This process allows for
intensive monitoring, early detection of deterioration
in the credit portfolio and appropriate follow-up
measures; or
Å More than 30 days past due.
A transfer to stage 3 will always be the result of the
default of a financial instrument. A default is considered
to have occurred when one of the default triggers (e.g.
unlikely to pay, distressed debt restructuring, bankruptcy
or fraud) is met. In addition, 90 days past due is used
as a backstop for default. Materiality thresholds are
applied for counterparties transferring to stage 3
(EUR 500 for programme lending and EUR 5,000
for non-programme lending). Below these thresholds,
amounts are reported as >90 days past due. Our
definitions of default and impaired are aligned.

Favourable changes in credit risk are recognised
consistently with unfavourable changes in credit risk,
except when applying a probation period for financial
instruments that are forborne or more than 30 days
past due. Forborne financial instruments are only
transferred back from stage 2 to stage 1 after a two-year
probation period. Stage 3 forborne instruments transfer
back to stage 2 consistently with other defaulted
instruments. For 30 days past due financial instruments,
a three-month probation period is applied for transfers
from stage 2 to stage 1.
Calculation method
The amount of expected credit loss allowances is
based on the probability-weighted present value of all
expected cash shortfalls over the remaining life of the
financial instrument for both on- and off-balance sheet
exposures. ABN AMRO makes a distinction between
two types of calculation methods for credit loss
allowances:
Å Individual LECL for credit-impaired (stage 3)
financial instruments with exposures above
EUR 3 million; and
Å Collective 12-month ECL (stage 1) and LECL
for (stage 2 and 3) financial instruments that have
similar credit risk characteristics (e.g. residential
mortgages, consumer loans, SME loans) are
clustered in portfolios and collectively assessed
for impairment losses. A collective impairment
calculation approach based on individual parameters
is also applied for exposures below EUR 3 million.
ABN AMRO has introduced new models to quantify
the Probability of Loss (PL), Loss Given Loss (LGL)
and Exposure at Loss (EAL) for calculating the
collective 12-month ECL and LECL for these financial
instruments. Whereas the credit loss allowance for
these assets is collectively determined, the stage is
determined for each individual financial instrument
separately.

Risk, funding & capital / Risk, funding & capital management / Credit risk management
Lifetime expected credit loss
ABN AMRO defines the lifetime of credit as the
maximum contractual period over which the bank is
exposed to credit risk and not a longer period, even if
that longer period is consistent with business practice.
For some contracts, such as overdraft facilities or credit
card, no end date is specified or amounts can be
contractually withdrawn by the lender at short notice.
In these cases, ABN AMRO uses behavioural maturity
models that rely on historical client behaviour, given
that the exposure to credit losses can extend beyond
the contractual period.
Forward-looking information
Three different scenarios of future economic
developments are incorporated into the IFRS 9 expected
credit loss calculation and risk stage determination in
a probability weighted manner (at 31 December 2018:
baseline 60%, up 15%, down 25%). These scenarios
are developed by ABN AMRO Group Economics at
least every quarter and reviewed at each reporting
date. The 28 macroeconomic variables (including GDP,
unemployment rate, housing price index, oil price and
Euribor 3M) are forecasted by ABN AMRO Group
Economics and used for the expected credit loss
calculation and selected for each specific portfolio
separately. The variables we use are based on statistical
relevance and expert judgement. ABN AMRO has
aligned its forward-looking scenarios with those
used in the budgeting process. Specific forecasts
of macroeconomic variables are made for two to
three years, while subsequent periods gradually
align to the long-term average.
Non-performing versus default and impaired
For reporting purposes, and to calculate the correct
impairment allowances, ABN AMRO distinguishes
between performing and non-performing exposures.
The criteria for non-performing are broader than
for default.
Å An exposure is qualified as non-performing if it is either:
Å in default;
Å a performing forborne exposure in a probation
period that was classified as non-performing at
the time of the latest forbearance measure or
as a consequence of entering the forbearance
status and that receives an additional forbearance
measure;
Å a performing forborne exposure in a probation
period that was classified as non-performing
at the time of the latest forbearance measure
or as a consequence of entering the forbearance
status and that becomes more than 30 days
past due;
Å a forborne exposure that was classified as in
default and where the default triggers are no
longer applicable, but that is still in the nonperforming cure period of at least 12 months.
Å An exposure is categorised as non-performing for
the entire amount, not taking into account any
available collateral, and including the following
revocable and irrevocable off-balance items:
Å loan commitments;
Å financial guarantees at risk of being called,
including the underlying guaranteed exposure
that meets the criteria of non-performing;
Å any other potential financial commitments.
Write-off
When a loan is deemed no longer collectible, it is
written off against the related loan loss allowance,
specifically if:
Å the likelihood of debt repayment falls below
a certain point (e.g. in the event of bankruptcy
or a cash flow shortfall); or
Å the financial asset reaches a certain stage of
delinquency (e.g. if agreed terms are no longer
complied with or the borrower has left ABN AMRO).
Such loans are written off after all the necessary
procedures have been completed and the amount of
the loss has been determined. Subsequent recoveries
of amounts previously written off are credited to
impairment charges on loans and advances in the
income statement.
Most of the programme lending facilities are
automatically written-off after 1,080 days in default. 
A partial write-off can be recorded in the case
of individual files (non-programme lending)
and if a material coverage deficit arises.

ABN AMRO is exposed to market risk in its banking book
and trading book.
Market risk in the banking book
Market risk in the banking book is the risk that the
bv2
value or the income of the bank will decline because of
unfavourable market movements. The following market
risks are inherent in the banking book:
Å Interest rate risk: the risk of losses in the economic
value of equity or the bank’s net interest income (NII)
due to unfavourable yield curve developments; 
Å Credit spread risk: the risk of losses due to adverse
movements in the credit spread of liquid assets.
The principal source is from bonds held for liquidity
purposes; 
Å Funding spread risk: the risk of losses due to adverse
movements in the term structure of rates at which
ABN AMRO can borrow money – expressed as a
spread to a benchmark such as Euribor; 
Å Equity risk: the risk of losses due to adverse
movements in equity prices, dividends and volatilities.
Equity positions can be taken in strategic partnerships
and joint ventures, positions in private equity and
positions where debt held by the bank has been
converted into equity as part of a restructuring process; 
Å Property risk: this risk arising from adverse movements
in property prices; 
Å Foreign exchange risk: this risk arising from adverse
movements in FX spot and forward rates and/or
FX volatility. It arises for operational reasons where
it is inefficient to hedge exposures as they arise.
Market risk in the banking book consists predominantly
of interest rate risk, followed by credit spread risk and
funding spread risk.
Interest rate risk in the banking book
In order to model and measure interest rate risk,
assumptions are made about client behaviour, most
importantly with respect to the maturity of savings and
the prepayment of mortgages. The nature of these
assumptions can substantially alter the anticipated interest
cash flow pattern. Interest rate risk is continuously
managed in line with the risk appetite, as the profile
of assets and liabilities on the balance sheet can change
if client behaviour changes.
The main sources of interest rate risk are:
Å The maturity mismatch between assets and liabilities.
ABN AMRO provides mortgages and commercial
loans with long-term fixed interest terms. These assets
are funded by savings and wholesale funding. These
liabilities have a shorter average interest maturity than
the assets, for example current accounts;
Å Actual client behaviour, which determines the maturity
of some of our client products. As we use models
to predict this behaviour, we are exposed to model
risk: losses the bank could incur as a consequence
of decisions resulting from errors in the development,
implementation or use of such models.
Key assumptions for modelling client behaviour
From an interest rate risk perspective, the following
u
aspects of client behaviour are the most important:
Å Client behaviour with respect to early redemption
of residential mortgages. This has a significant impact
on average interest maturity of the mortgage portfolio.
Clients have the option of fully or partially prepaying
mortgages before maturity. These prepayments
are triggered by client behaviour such as relocation,
redemption and curtailment. An important driver of
prepayments is the rate incentive, i.e. the difference
between the client’s existing mortgage interest
rate and prevailing mortgage rates. The prevailing
mortgage rates are forecasted using a Monte Carlo
simulation. In addition to interest incentive, drivers such
as loan age, seasonality and house price developments
are taken into account;
Å Client acceptance of the volume offered and the
deviation between the offered rate and the actual
coupon on an offered residential mortgage;
Å Client behaviour with respect to non-maturing deposits
which are callable on demand. These savings and
current accounts are modelled using a replicating
portfolio model to forecast future client rates. These
future client rates may depend on current or lagged
yield curves and funding costs. A maximum maturity
of 10 years is assumed for non-maturing deposits. The
resulting duration depends on product type and client
behaviour. The average duration for retail portfolios is
2.6 years, whereas the average duration for non-retail
portfolios is 2.4 years. The average duration for the
aggregate portfolio of modelled non-maturing deposits
is 2.5 years, well below the regulatory 5-year cap.
The metrics used for banking book risks are dependent
upon the assumptions made in the behavioural models.
Models must therefore be based on extensive research,
including historical data on observed client behaviour.
Models must also be validated by the independent Model
Validation Department and approved by duly authorised
risk committees. Models are assessed to determine
whether they behave appropriately and are statistically
sound; if required, they are adjusted.

at Risk and economic capital for market risk in the banking
book. These are complemented with stress testing and
scenario analysis, which are used to ensure a comprehensive
approach to risk management and to identify potential
weakness. Stress testing and scenario analysis go beyond
determining the impact of alternative developments of
interest rates. Assumptions with respect to modelling
and client behaviour are also tested.
NII-at-Risk is the difference in NII between a base scenario
and an alternative scenario. It is defined as the worst
outcome of the following scenarios: gradual increase or
decrease in interest rates by 200bps, measured over a
one-year period, and instantaneous increase or decrease
of 100bps. NII-at-Risk includes all expected cash flows,
including commercial margins and other spread components,
from all interest-rate-sensitive assets, liabilities and offbalance sheet items in the banking book. When calculating
the NII-at-Risk, a constant balance sheet is assumed where
maturing positions are reinvested. A floor of -100bps on
market rates as well as a floor of 0bps on retail deposits
is applied.
Duration of equity measures value changes resulting from
minor parallel shifts of the yield curve. The computation of
duration is based on a comparison between a base curve
and the change in the economic value of a portfolio due
to an interest rate increase/decrease. We also measure
the value sensitivity to changes in individual maturities
on the yield curve.
EVE-at-Risk is the loss in economic value of equity as a
result of various yield curve shocks. These shocks are bow
up, bow down, steepening, flattening and tilt short end
up and down. The impact is calculated for cash flows from
all interest-rate-sensitive assets, liabilities and off-balance
sheet items in the banking book. An assumption of a runoff balance sheet is made, where banking book positions
amortise and are not replaced by any new business.
The projected cash flows include commercial margins
and other spread components and are discounted
at the risk-free rate.
Economic capital for market risk in the banking book
is calculated using a VaR model which determines the
economic capital needed to absorb losses due to adverse
movements in interest rates, credit spreads and foreign
exchange rates. The model also accounts for the potential
impact of client behaviour, such as prepayments on
mortgages and changes in deposits and savings balances.
Credit spread risk in the banking book
Credit spread risk for the liquidity portfolio is measured
and limited as the impact on economic value of a 1bp
change in spreads to a swap rate. This is done across
the term structure of exposure, as well as for a parallel
shift across the curve.
Funding spread risk
Funding spread movements can reflect changes in,
for example, the perceived credit quality of ABN AMRO,
changes in the competitive environment or changes
in liquidity premiums. They may be entity-specific or
systemic in nature. If funding spreads widen, it costs
more to fund assets on the balance sheet. Unless this
increased spread is passed on to clients by increasing
client rates, projected net interest income will decrease.
Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises from several sources.
The main sources are assets and liabilities on the balance
sheet and off-balance sheet commitments and contingent
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. ABN AMRO
measures and manages foreign exchange risk for which
the key metric is the Open Currency Position. In addition,
translation risks on the bank’s capital ratios, which may
be affected by exchange rate movements, are also
specifically monitored. ABN AMRO aims not to be
exposed to open currency exposures in its banking book.
Market risk management for the banking book
ABN AMRO has in place a detailed risk management
framework to identify, measure and control market risk
in the banking book. This framework provides assurance
that the banking book activities remain consistent with
the bank’s moderate risk profile. The goal of interest
rate risk management is to protect current and future
NII from adverse yield curve movements. The day-to-day
management is delegated from the Asset & Liability
Committee to Asset and Liability Management, while
Treasury is responsible for the execution.
The bank applies limits to the above-mentioned interest
rate risk measures in line with the approved risk appetite
requirement. The risk appetite is based on the maximum
loss the bank is willing to accept, both in terms of net
interest income for one- and two-year periods and
economic value of equity.
ABN AMRO uses a combination of portfolio (macro)
hedges and specific asset or liability (micro) hedges
to swap fixed interest rates for floating interest rate
positions. Micro hedges are used to swap fixed funding
transactions and fixed investments in the liquidity buffer
for floating interest rate positions. In addition, macro
hedging is applied in order to be in line with the bank’s
strategy to contribute to a stable NII while protecting
the economic value of equity.

Market risk in the trading book
As part of its business strategy, ABN AMRO facilitates
2
client orders, acts as a market maker in key markets and
provides liquidity to clients, including institutional investors
and private clients. Market risk in the trading book is
the risk of losses in market value due to adverse market
movements. The following market risks are inherent
in the trading book:
Å Interest rate risk: arises from adverse changes in
interest rate risk curves and/or interest rate volatilities;
Å Credit spread risk: arises from adverse changes in
the term structure of credit spreads and/or from
changing credit quality of debt securities or CDS
reference entities, with impact on default probabilities;
Å Equity risk: arises from adverse changes in equity
prices, dividends and volatilities;
Å Commodity risk: arises from adverse changes
in commodity prices;
Å Foreign exchange risk: arises from adverse changes
in FX spot and forward rates and/or FX volatility.

bv
ABN AMRO has in place a detailed risk management
framework to identify, measure and control market risk
in the trading book. This framework provides assurance
that the bank’s trading activities are consistent with its
client-focused business strategy and moderate risk profile.
In accordance with the strategy, the Trading Business Risk
Committee annually approves trading mandates, which
define the nature and amount of the permitted transactions
and risks, and the associated constraints. The Trading
Business Risk Committee is a subsidiary committee
of the Group Risk Committee.
Market risk measurement for the trading book
bv8ufg
ABN AMRO measures and manages market risk in the
trading book on a daily basis. The key metrics used are
economic capital, regulatory capital, Value-at-Risk (VaR),
Stressed VaR (SVaR) and Incremental Risk Charge (IRC),
together with a wide array of stress and scenario tests,
sensitivity measures, concentration limits and notional
limits. These metrics are measured and monitored, with
appropriate limits set at both bank and business-line levels.
Metrics and models are managed, reviewed, assessed
and, if required, adjusted in a similar way as in the banking
book. Other important tools to ensure the adequacy of
the models, alongside the formal validation and review of
models, are the daily explanation of risk reporting figures,
periodic portfolio reviews and regular back-testing.
Value-at-Risk
ABN AMRO uses the historical simulation Value-at-Risk
(VaR) methodology as one of its primary risk measures.
The VaR for market risk quantifies, with a one-sided
confidence level of 99%, the maximum one-day loss
that could occur due to changes in risk factors if positions
remain unchanged for a period of one day. The VaR
also incorporates market data movements for specific
movements in the underlying issuer of securities.
The impact of historical market movements on today’s
portfolio is estimated on the basis of equally weighted
market movements observed in the previous 300 days,
using a full revaluation method for the majority of risk
factors. The bank uses the VaR with a one-day horizon
for internal risk measurement, control and back-testing,
and the VaR with a ten-day horizon to determine regulatory
capital. The latter is derived by scaling the one-day VaR
by the square root of ten.
The daily VaR is back-tested against the actual mark-tomarket changes calculated for each subsequent trading
day. The number of outliers is used to assess the reliability
of the VaR model. The model’s back-testing performance
is satisfactory.
Stressed VaR
The purpose of the SVaR is to replicate a VaR calculation
that would be generated on the bank’s current portfolio
with inputs calibrated to historical data for a continuous
12-month period of significant financial stress relevant to
the bank’s portfolio. To calculate the SVaR, ABN AMRO
uses the same model as used for the VaR (historical
simulation). The current historical data period includes
the peak of the credit crisis of 2008 and is reviewed
at least annually.
Incremental Risk Charge
By calculating the Incremental Risk Charge (IRC),
ABN AMRO calculates an estimate of the default and
migration risks for credit products in the trading book over
a one-year capital horizon, with a 99.9% confidence level.
Potential profits and losses over the one-year time horizon
are created by simulating scenarios showing how the
issuer’s credit ratings may change (including possible
defaults), taking correlations between different issuers
into account, and repricing the positions. The simulated
scenarios correspond to an instantaneous shock over the
one-year period; in this way, ABN AMRO uses a one-year
liquidity horizon for all its positions under the scope of the
IRC model. Rating transitions and defaults are dependent
upon individual issuer rating transition probabilities and
correlations between issuer migrations. For the individual
transition matrices, data from external vendors are used.
The correlation matrices are the same as the matrices
used to determine the Credit Risk Economic Capital.

Stress testing and scenario analysis
Stress testing and scenario analysis are designed to focus
specifically on the impact of tail events which are outside
the VaR confidence interval. We perform daily stress tests
for large movements in risk factors. Scenario analyses
are also conducted frequently to evaluate the impacts
of extreme market events that cover multiple risk factors,
and the results of these tests are monitored. These scenarios
can be based either on historical or hypothetical events,
or on a combination of the two.
For the trading book, we take into account adjustments for
counterparty risk on our clients (Credit Valuation Adjustment),
ABN AMRO funding costs (Funding Valuation Adjustment)
and ABN AMRO credit risk (Debt Valuation Adjustment).
Capital for market risk in the trading book
Regulatory capital
The bank has implemented the Internal Models Approach
(IMA) to calculate market risk capital for its trading book.
ABN AMRO has excluded the following activities from
its IMA capital and calculates these by means of the
standardised approach:
Å Trading activities in Brazil;
Å Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities Trading;
Å Private Banking International activities.
Economic capital
Calculation of economic capital for market risk in the
trading book is based on a daily Value-at-Risk (VaR)
market risk measure and historical scenarios simulating
stress events such as ‘Black Monday’ and the financial
markets crisis.

Risk, funding & capital / Risk, funding & capital management / Operational risk management 55
Operational risk is defined as the risk of loss resulting
from inadequate or failed internal processes, people or
systems or from external events. This definition is in line
with the definition by the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision. Operational risk is often also referred to
internally as non-financial risk, covering risks such as
HR risk, IT risk, compliance risk, legal risk, change risk,
tax risk and model risk. 
ABN AMRO has a converged approach to operational risk
and aims to provide the business with a clear and fair view
on the operational risks that the bank faces and the way
these should be managed. For this purpose, ABN AMRO
has in place a framework that enables operational risks to
be managed within the moderate risk profile. Operational
risk management sets the framework for the bank in line
with the requirements for the Advanced Measurement
Approach (AMA). It evolves and is kept up-to-date as
experience gained is incorporated.

Operational risk management approach
Employees are expected and encouraged to be alert to
v
and aware of operational risks in their day-to-day work.
Operational risk management is strongly embedded in daily
business processes. First-line managers are responsible
for managing operational risks and are supported by a
professional operational risk management organisation.
Operational risk management works in close cooperation
with other second-line parties, including Compliance, Legal,
Crime & Integrity, Information Security and Business
Continuity Management, which also use the operational
risk framework. This reflects the bank’s view that managing
operational risk requires a concerted effort on the part
of all these departments.
Operational risk is incorporated into risk reports at various
levels within the bank, up to the Executive Board and
Supervisory Board.
Framework for operational risk management
v2
Assessments and monitoring activities are at the heart
of the operational risk management framework. Business
managers use assessments to identify and assess risks,
including scenarios for rare events. Assessments are
executed for business-as-usual activities and for new
initiatives. If a risk exceeds the risk appetite, the business
manager takes appropriate action. At least once a year,
business managers monitor the effectiveness of the controls
in their area of responsibility. Controls are strengthened,
if necessary. Key Risk Indicators are monitored to signal
adverse risk developments. Despite all the preventive
measures in place, incidents and operational losses cannot
always be avoided. The bank therefore systematically
collects information and analyses such events in order
to take appropriate action. Action taken may consist of
mitigating risks by strengthening controls or avoiding risks
by closing down or not starting operations. Management
can also decide to consciously accept a certain risk or
transfer a risk to insurance companies. A global insurance
programme is in place, and this is reviewed annually by
the Group Risk Committee.
Once a year, senior management reviews the strategic
business objectives and all measures taken from a risk
perspective. At the end of each year, and based on these
strategic risk assessments, senior management signs
a Management Control Statement, which is included
at the end of this section.
Specific operational risk areas
The bank has in place a dedicated organisation for
v
operational risk areas that require specific knowledge,
such as information security and business continuity
management.
Information security 
Information is one of the bank’s most valuable assets.
ABN AMRO’s clients rely on the proper functioning of
the bank’s information systems. These systems run in
complex information infrastructures, connecting the bank’s
networks to public networks. Banking processes and
their supporting information systems are consequently
inherently vulnerable, with the result that the security
of client data and services can be threatened.

Examples of such threats include computer-assisted
fraud, unauthorised disclosure of confidential information,
virus infections, computer hacking and denial of service
attacks (DDoS).
In recognition of the importance of protecting the bank’s
information and its associated assets, such as systems
and infrastructure, at all times, ABN AMRO has established
a structured information security approach to ensure the
confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. This
approach defines the organisational framework, management
and staff responsibilities, and the information security
directives that apply to ABN AMRO, its vendors and third
parties with whom the bank exchanges information.
Business continuity management 
Business continuity management ensures organisational
resilience at all levels of the ABN AMRO organisation
and the ability to respond effectively to threats, thus
safeguarding stakeholders’ interests and the organisation’s
reputation, brand and value-creating activities. Business
continuity focuses on:
Å Analysing threats and the business impact of calamities
and crises;
Å Determining the strategies and solutions to be applied
in the event of a crisis – such as business recovery,
crisis management and IT disaster recovery planning –
so as to enable continuity of business operations;
Å Documenting, periodically assessing and testing
of these strategies and solutions.
Operational risk measurement
In line with the Advanced Measurement Approach (AMA),
v
the bank has in place a model to define the required level
of own funds for operational risk (operational risk capital).
This model predicts potential operational risk losses
(annually aggregated) by combining a forward-looking
and a backward-looking view on operational risk events.
Risk and control self-assessments and scenario analyses
provide a forward-looking view: experts build scenarios
to understand future risks and estimate the severity of
potential losses. The resulting estimates are used as
data input for the model. In these scenarios, experts
take into consideration the quality of the bank’s control
environment, its processes, systems and people as well
as external circumstances and changes that may have an
influence. The current relevance of the estimations (and
hence of the capital) is safeguarded by reconsidering the
scenarios regularly, but also when major changes in the
risk profile occur. Next to these expert-based estimations,
the model also uses ‘backward looking’ historical loss data
from ABN AMRO as well as from the banking industry.
Historical loss data is included as it is assumed to have
predictive power for the future.
Capital for operational risk
The level of AMA capital is derived from the results of the
model calculations. The bank applies a 99.95% confidence
level to the annually aggregated losses to calculate the
operational risk economic capital, whereas a 99.9%
confidence level is applied to calculate regulatory
operational risk capital. The adequacy of the capital levels
is monitored on a quarterly basis and if issues occur –
for example regarding the reliability of data – add-ons
can be applied.

Risk, funding & capital / Risk, funding & capital management / Funding & liquidity risk management 57
Liquidity risk is the risk that actual and potential payments
or collateral posting obligations cannot be met on a timely
basis, or only at excessive costs. There are two types of
liquidity risk:
Å Funding liquidity risk is the risk of not being able to
accommodate both expected and unexpected current
and future cash outflows and collateral needs because
insufficient cash is available. Eventually, this can affect
the bank’s daily operations or its financial condition;
Å Market liquidity risk is the risk that the bank cannot
sell an asset in a timely manner at a reasonable market
price due to insufficient market depth (insufficient
supply and demand) or market disruption. Market
liquidity risk includes the sensitivity in liquidity value
of a portfolio due to changes in the applicable haircuts
and market value. It also concerns uncertainty about the
time required to realise the liquidity value of the assets.
Strategy
Liquidity
4ia
We have a liquidity risk management framework in place
that helps us maintain a moderate risk profile and safeguards
ABN AMRO’s reputation from a liquidity perspective.
This framework enables the bank to meet the regulatory
requirements and its payment obligations at a reasonable
cost, even under severely adverse conditions. We have
formulated a set of liquidity risk metrics and limits to
manage the bank’s liquidity position. By maintaining a
smooth long-term maturity profile, limiting dependence
on wholesale funding and holding a solid liquidity buffer in
our main currencies, we maintain a prudent liquidity profile.
Funding
ABN AMRO’s main source of funding consists of deposits
from Retail Banking, Private Banking, Commercial Banking
and CIB clients. The remainder of our funding is raised
largely through various long-term wholesale funding
instruments. ABN AMRO’s strategy for wholesale funding
is derived from the bank’s moderate risk profile. This
strategy aims to optimise and diversify the bank’s funding
sources in order to maintain market access and the
targeted funding position. We aim to have a balance sheet
with a diverse, stable and cost-efficient funding base.
The funding strategy takes into account the following
guidelines:
Å Maintain market access by diversifying funding sources
in different funding markets (Europe, the US and
the Asia Pacific region);
Å Optimise funding costs within the targets set for
volumes and maturities;
Å Maintain strong relationships with the investor base
through active marketing;
Å Optimise the balance between private placements
and public benchmark deals;
Å Build, maintain and manage credit curves in different
funding programmes and currencies;
Å Continually monitor attractive funding opportunities for
ABN AMRO and investment opportunities for investors;
Å Optimise the planning and execution of funding in
different market windows and currencies.
Risk management approach
bv2i
The natural maturity mismatch between loans and funding
requires liquidity risk management. We consider maturity
transformation to be an integral part of the bank’s business
model, which is why we closely monitor our liquidity
position and the resulting risks. We diversify our funding
sources to maintain market access, and we diversify
funding tenors to avoid a concentration of outflows.
We also hold a portfolio of highly liquid assets that
can be converted into cash in the event of unforeseen
market disruptions, thus allowing us to meet payment
and collateral obligations at all times.
Funding and liquidity risk is managed centrally.
We incorporate liquidity costs into the pricing of our
day-to-day business activities.
In managing the risks, a clear distinction is made between
going-concern and contingency risk management.
Going-concern management
Going-concern management entails management of
the day-to-day liquidity position within specified limits.
This allows us to meet payment obligations on a timely
basis. The most important metrics we use are:
Å Stress testing: We conduct monthly and ad hoc stress
tests in which we evaluate the impact of cash in- and
outflows under plausible stress scenarios. Both marketwide and bank-specific stress scenarios are defined
and analysed. The goal of stress testing is twofold.
Firstly, it helps us to review our risk framework,
i.e. the liquidity buffer size, risk appetite and limits.
Secondly, it allows us to identify ways to reduce
outflows in times of crisis;
Å Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR): The objective of the
LCR is to assess the bank’s short-term resilience by
ensuring sufficient high-quality liquid assets to survive
a significant stress scenario lasting 30 calendar days;
Å Survival period: The survival period reflects the period
that the bank’s liquidity position is expected to remain
positive in an internal stress scenario in which wholesale
funding markets deteriorate and retail and commercial
clients withdraw a proportion of their deposits;

Risk, funding & capital
Risk, funding & capital / Risk, funding & capital management / Funding & liquidity risk management
Å Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR): The objective of
the NSFR is to assess resilience over a longer time
horizon by creating additional incentives for banks
to fund their activities from stable sources of funding
on an ongoing basis;
Å Loan-to-Deposit ratio (LtD): The LtD ratio measures
the relationship between the loan book (Loans and
advances to customers) and deposits from clients (Due
to customers). The ratio includes all client-driven loans
and deposits, but excludes loans to and deposits from
governments. The LtD ratio gives an indication of our
dependence on wholesale funding for financing client
loans. Due to the mandatory and collective Dutch
pension savings schemes, mortgage loans outweigh
client savings balances in the Netherlands, thus driving
the LtD ratio above 100%.
Contingency risk management
Contingency risk management aims to ensure that,
v
in the event of either a bank-specific or general market
stress event, the bank is able to generate sufficient
liquidity to withstand a short- or long-term liquidity crisis.
Å Contingency Funding Plan: The Contingency Funding
Plan (CFP) sets out the guidelines and responsibilities
for addressing possible liquidity shortfalls in emergency
situations. This only comes into effect if the liquidity
position is threatened, or if strong indications exist that
liquidity stress is imminent. The CFP is aligned with the
Recovery Plan, as required by the regulators. It enables
us to manage our liquidity without unnecessarily
jeopardising business lines, while limiting excessive
funding costs in severe market circumstances;
Å Collateral posting in the event of a rating downgrade:
If ABN AMRO’s credit rating is downgraded, collateral
requirements may increase. ABN AMRO monitors
these potential additional collateral postings in its
liquidity management framework;
Å Liquidity buffer: ABN AMRO holds a liquidity buffer
to accommodate cash outflows during stress. This
buffer consists of unencumbered, high-quality liquid
assets, including government bonds, retained securities
(RMBS and Covered Bonds) and cash.

Risk, funding & capital / Risk, funding & capital management / Capital management 59
Capital management strategy
The primary objective of the capital management strategy
v4w
is to ensure that capital adequacy requirements are met at
all times and that sufficient capital is available to support
the bank’s strategy. Capital is a necessary resource
for doing business and defines the bank’s commercial
possibilities. The balance between available and required
capital is managed centrally to optimise the use of
available capital. The basis of the capital management
strategy is the bank’s risk appetite and its business plans.
Other important factors taken into account when
managing the capital position are expectations and
requirements of external stakeholders (such as regulators,
investors, shareholders, equity analysts, rating agencies
and clients), the bank’s position in the market, market
developments, contingent capital needs and the feasibility
of capital management actions. Although ABN AMRO
manages its capital centrally, the group companies are
sufficiently capitalised to comply with all local regulatory
solvency requirements and to meet any local business
needs. ABN AMRO’s banking activities are carried out
by legal entities that are part of the Group’s corporate
tax unit. Apart from prevailing statutory and regulatory
legislation, there are no specific material impediments
for prompt transfer of the bank’s regulatory capital.
Dividend
ABN AMRO’s dividend policy takes into account
matters including current and pending regulatory capital
requirements, our risk profile, growth in commercial
activities and market factors. The dividend payout is set in
the light of the bank’s moderate risk profile and regulatory
changes and to ensure that dividend payments can be
maintained in the future.
Capital measurement and allocation
Capital adequacy is measured and monitored on an
ongoing basis against target capital ratios, which are
derived from the bank’s overall risk appetite and strategy.
Capital projections and stress test scenarios, both marketwide and bank-specific, are used to ensure that actual
and future capital levels remain above the targets.
Capital is allocated to businesses in a way that optimises
the long-term value of the bank while serving the bank’s
strategic objectives. In the capital allocation process,
both risk-based and non-risk-based return parameters are
considered, taking into account economic and regulatory
capital requirements. This process ensures that the bank
meets its return targets while maintaining a moderate risk
profile, in line with the bank’s risk appetite.
Contingency capital management
Contingency plans are in place to address any capital
issues arising. The Contingency Capital Plan provides a
framework to detect capital adequacy stress by setting
out various early warning indicators. The plan also sets
out a range of actions that can be undertaken, based
on the level of severity and urgency of the issues.
Recovery and resolution planning
The Bank Recovery & Resolution Directive requires a
recovery plan and a resolution plan to be in place for
ABN AMRO. ABN AMRO submitted a reviewed and
updated version of its group recovery plan to the ECB
in December 2018. The Single Resolution Board (SRB)
has prepared a resolution plan for ABN AMRO. The SRB
has concluded that the preferred resolution strategy
for ABN AMRO is a Single-Point-of-Entry (SPE) strategy,
with ABN AMRO Bank N.V. as the resolution entity.
ABN AMRO expects to continue issuing external MRELeligible instruments through ABN AMRO Bank N.V.

Risk, funding & capital
Risk, funding & capital / Risk, funding & capital management / Business risk management
ABN AMRO manages business risk in order to preserve
its business earnings, independent of external or other
developments. Business risk management limits the
effects of changes in actual and forecasted business
earnings. Earnings are affected by various internal and
external factors, such as changes in client preferences,
competition, and economic and geopolitical developments
and regulations. We continually monitor and respond
to these factors.
The key criteria for classifying a risk as a business risk are:
Å An event that leads to uncertainty in present or future
business earnings and/or franchise value;
Å Changes of drivers of future business earnings
such as uncertainty in volumes, margins, fee and
commission rates and/or business expenses.
The bank mitigates sensitivity to business risk drivers
through management practices that address developments
in these drivers in an effective and timely manner.
Business risk is also mitigated by a capital buffer.
The bank’s strategy and business risk are related.
The strategy incorporates mitigation of uncertain events
and business risk drivers. Annual review of the strategy
ensures alignment with business risk developments.
To ensure that the bank’s strategy is pursued and the
strategic goals are met in the long term, our business
plans and budgets take these strategic goals into account.
Economic capital for business risk
Economic capital is used to mitigate the negative effects
of unexpected business risk events. The economic capital
for business risk reflects the maximum downward deviation
of actual versus expected net operating profit in one year.
To determine the economic capital for business risk, a
combination of historical and forward-looking scenarios
is collected from experts in each business line. These
scenarios determine the sensitivity of macroeconomic
variables or industry performance indicators to the business
lines’ income. This sensitivity is used to determine the
volatility of income for each business line, as well as any
correlation between them. Based on the individual volatilities,
we use simulation to calculate bank-wide volatility.

ABN AMRO aims to make a positive contribution to
safeguarding human rights, health and safety, and the
environment through its financing and investment services.
We recognise, however, that in our roles as lender and
investor, the bank may be exposed to sustainability risks,
through the direct activities of our clients and the companies
in which we invest on behalf of our clients, and through
the activities performed in the value chains of these
companies. To manage these sustainability risks, we have
defined a specific risk appetite in line with the bank’s
moderate risk profile.
Sustainability risk policy framework
ABN AMRO uses a sustainability risk policy framework
which is governed according to the bank’s ‘three lines
of defence’ model. The policy framework covers activities
ranging from corporate lending and payment and
investment services to procurement, human resources
and product development.
Our sustainability risk policy framework is constantly
evolving: we develop new policies or adjust existing ones
based on feedback and input from stakeholders.
The bank’s Exclusion List was updated in December 2018.
It contains our ‘red lines’, criteria we use to decide when
to engage with, or when to exclude, a client. In 2017, the
bank decided to stop lending to tobacco manufacturers.
In 2018, we decided to also exclude other companies
in the tobacco value chain when revenues from these
activities exceed 50% of the consolidated turnover.
Other exclusions were aligned with the existing relevant
international standards, such as CITES and UNGPs, or
those formulated by UNESCO and IUCN. The separate
sector policies have been merged into one sustainability
risk policy with sector requirements. New chapters on
Chemicals & Pharma and Transportation were added
and the chapter on Metals & Minerals has undergone
a comprehensive update. The human rights criteria are
tailored to the salient issues in the sector.
Human rights
One of the focus areas of our sustainability risk policy
framework is managing human rights risks in accordance
with the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights. In line with these principles, we have integrated
human rights assessment criteria into our lending,
investment and corporate procurement activities. Our
focus areas are discrimination, privacy, labour rights and
land-related human rights.
In 2018, we contributed to working groups for the
implementation of the Dutch Banking Sector Agreement
on international responsible business conduct regarding
human rights. This sector agreement includes
commitments to achieve a material positive impact
for people (potentially) facing adverse human rights
impacts in connection with our products and services.
We organised human rights training sessions for
employees to better embed the understanding of human
rights risks and the leverage we can use, and thus prevent
or mitigate these risks. We prolonged our public-private
cooperation with the Inspectorate SZW and the University
of Amsterdam to proactively detect labour exploitation
using knowledge-sharing, data analysis, open-source
research and transaction analysis.
Client and investment management
Client acceptance is crucial to our approach to managing
sustainability risks. We have in place instruments to identify
potential breaches of our sustainability policies and we
do not do business with companies not willing or able
to run their business responsibly. Similar checks on
exclusions and controversies apply to the investment
universe provided to our clients via our investment services.
In corporate lending, the bank performs a sustainability
assessment for transactions entailing an increased
sustainability risk. This assessment is based on the ESE
standards in our sustainability risk policy framework and
focuses on our clients’ compliance, commitment, capacity
and track record in terms of managing its sustainability risk.
This means that we may decide to accept transactions
with a high sustainability risk profile, as long as our client
is capable of managing these risks and operates within the
limits of our sustainability sector policies and procedures.
In 2018, we continued to integrate this assessment into
our credit application systems by further implementing our
Global Sustainability Risk Indicator (GSRI). Corporate and
Institutional Banking started using this assessment tool
in the second quarter of 2018. We also introduced a
new dashboard to provide clients with feedback on their
sustainability performance and opportunities for improving
their performance. Our ambition is to further develop the
GSRI tool to enhance the way we rate our clients’
sustainability performance and use the results for our
monitoring and reporting, and to perform portfolio analysis.
Client engagement
In order not to just manage risk, but also to use our leverage
to positively affect our relationships with our clients,
business partners and companies that clients can invest
in, we strive for an inclusive approach. Most companies
meet our sustainability policy requirements. In certain
instances, a company might not meet our requirements
(yet), either prior to or during the relationship. In these
cases we enter into a dialogue with the company
in question.

Risk, funding & capital
Risk, funding & capital / Risk, funding & capital management / Sustainability risk management
The goal of such a dialogue or engagement is to improve
the sustainability performance of our clients, so that they
– at the very least – meet ABN AMRO’s sustainability
standards. Underperformers are not excluded immediately,
but they do have to be willing and able to enter into a
results-oriented process, as the success of engagement
depends on this commitment. We set a maximum term
within which improvements must take place. Typically,
this is three years, but in certain cases an extension is
possible – for instance when substantial improvements
have been made and full compliance is within reach;
the maximum term of engagement is always determined
on a case-by-case basis. Disengagement, although a last
resort, may be an outcome of the process.
Engagement is triggered by:
Å for clients: actual or potential breaches of our ESG
risk policy framework;
Å for companies in our investment universe: breaches
of the UN Global Compact. Investment universe
engagement is done in collaboration with Robeco,
unless the company is also our client.
Our engagement leverage for companies we finance
differs from companies our clients invest in. If we finance
a company, there is usually potential for direct engagement.
If not, or if for instance we are part of a loan syndicate
with other banks, engagement may be performed by a
third party. The engagement procedure is overseen by
a team from the relevant business line and the bank’s
sustainability advisors. Progress reports are drafted
on a quarterly basis and the Executive Board is informed
at least once a year.
We encourage clients to address negative ESG impacts.
However, we can rarely be sure there is a causal relationship
between engaging with our clients and the actions these
clients subsequently take to improve their management
of ESG issues. ABN AMRO is often one voice among
a diverse group of stakeholders who pursue the same
objective through different means. Where possible, given
client confidentiality and other constraints, we try to
cooperate with external stakeholders in order to maximise
positive impact.
Carbon accounting
Our policies and targets apply to the transition to a lowcarbon economy, and we also expect our focus on the
circular economy and sustainable assets to have a positive
impact. At the end of 2018, we started a project designed
to make this effect more measurable.
We want to raise the energy performance of all buildings
financed by ABN AMRO to energy label ‘A’ (on average) by
2030. Our progress on this target is shown in the Strategy
& performance section. ABN AMRO wants to ensure
compliance with Dutch regulations aimed at obtaining
at least energy label ‘C’ on all Dutch office buildings
by 2023. Our progress is reported according to the PCAF
method for carbon accounting.
Together with other Dutch financial institutions,
ABN AMRO participates in the Platform Carbon
Accounting for Financials (PCAF). PCAF is part of the
Dutch Sustainable Finance Platform, which is chaired
by the Dutch central bank (DNB). PCAF’s objective is
to improve carbon accounting by increasing transparency
and uniformity in carbon footprinting and target-setting
in the financial sector. PCAF intends to contribute to
the development of a harmonised framework for sciencebased targets and has developed a methodology for
measuring the carbon footprint of investments and loans.
The methodology enables financial institutions to align
their portfolios better with climate scenarios.
Recommendations for climate-related
financial disclosures
In September 2018 the Task Force on Climate-related
Financial Disclosures of the Financial Stability Board (FSB)
published its status report on the adoption of the TCFD
disclosure framework. This report concluded that the riskreturn profile of companies exposed to climate-related risks
may change significantly as a result of the physical impacts
of climate change, climate policy or new technologies.
In 2018, DNB performed an energy transition stress test
for the financial system in the Netherlands. The results
showed that in the event of a disruptive energy transition
the losses for financial institutions would be sizeable yet
manageable. To make them manageable, DNB advises
financial institutions to include energy transition risks in
their risk management policies. In addition, the European
Commission unveiled its strategy for a financial system
that supports the EU’s climate and sustainable development
agenda. The European Commission is developing guidelines
with regard to matters such as taxonomy, EU labels for green
financial products and metrics for measuring progress
towards a low-carbon economy and will publish these
guidelines in the coming years. The EU non-financial
reporting directive is expected to be aligned with the
TCFD requirements (as part of the 2019 revision).
ABN AMRO supports the TCFD’s recommendations and
believes their widespread adoption will lead to a more
informed dialogue on climate-related risks and opportunities
for our clients, investors and other stakeholders.
The carbon accounting activities described in this report
(PCAF, carbon risk implementation), together with our
Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) reporting on scopes 1
and 2 of our greenhouse gas emissions, constitute the
first steps ABN AMRO has taken towards implementing
the TCFD recommendations.

Risk, funding & capital / Risk, funding & capital management / Management Control Statement 63
Under Principle 1.4 (Risk management accountability) of
the Dutch Corporate Governance Code of December 2016,
ABN AMRO’s Executive Board is requested to render account
of the effectiveness of the bank’s design and operation
of its internal risk management and control systems.
ABN AMRO’s internal risk management and control is a
process effectuated by the Executive Board, management
and other personnel. It is designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the achievement of objectives
in the following categories:
Å Effectiveness and efficiency of operations;
Å Reliability of financial and non-financial information;
Å Compliance with laws, regulations and internal policies;
Å Safeguarding of assets, and identification and
management of liabilities, and;
Å Strategic and business objectives of ABN AMRO.
ABN AMRO’s first and second lines of defence perform
their roles in risk assessments, stress tests, evaluations
of the operating effectiveness of controls, and reporting
on risk management and control. The concluding results
are reported in and discussed at senior management
level through Enterprise Risk Management reports.
Group Audit, as the third line of defence, evaluates both
the design and effectiveness of ABN AMRO’s governance,
risk management and control processes. Audit reports are
discussed with risk and process owners. The Chief Audit
Executive (or his deputy) attended the Executive Board
and/or Executive Committee meetings every quarter to
discuss the Quarterly Audit Opinions. The evaluation of
the adequacy of ABN AMRO’s internal risk management
and control systems was regularly discussed with
the Audit Committee, the Risk & Capital Committee
and the full Supervisory Board in 2018.
Based on the risk management processes, the Executive
Board of ABN AMRO Group N.V. makes the following
statements regarding internal risk management and
control, taking into account ABN AMRO’s strategy and
moderate risk profile:
Å The Executive Board’s report in ABN AMRO’s Annual
Report 2018 provides sufficient insights into any failings
in the effectiveness of the internal risk management
and control systems;
Å The systems mentioned above provide reasonable
assurance that the financial reporting for 2018 does
not contain any material inaccuracies;
Å Based on the current state of affairs, preparation of
the financial reporting for 2018 on a going-concern
basis is justified (for more information, please refer
to note 1 of the Annual Financial Statements);
Å The Executive Board’s report states those material
risks and uncertainties that are relevant to expectations
regarding ABN AMRO’s continuity for the period of
twelve months after preparation of this report.
Regarding internal risk management and control systems,
the Executive Board has identified the following external
factors as potentially having an impact on ABN AMRO’s
current business model:
Å Limitations in the execution of the planned sustainable
growth strategies due to adverse macroeconomic
and monetary conditions (i.e. sustained low or negative
interest rates) and geopolitical uncertainty (such as the
impact of Brexit, trade tensions and sanctions).
Å Various laws and regulations (revised or otherwise)
may have an impact on ABN AMRO’s strategic position
and capital adequacy.
These external factors may impact specific businesses
or business models, ABN AMRO’s positioning vis-à-vis its
competitors (including fintechs, big techs and institutional
investors) or the level playing field in the financial sector,
thus hindering ABN AMRO in achieving its strategic goals.
Not being compliant with laws and regulations may
lead to reputational damage, fines and changes in
ABN AMRO’s income and cost basis or endanger longterm goals. Ensuring demonstrable compliance, both in
business-as-usual activities and in line with changes in
regulatory requirements, requires robust risk governance
and a substantial share of the bank’s resources.
Specific areas where the risk of non-compliance with
regulations requires substantial efforts by the bank are:
Å Customer Due Diligence/KnowYourClient,
Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism
Financing (CTF)
Given the increased regulatory attention and
requirements for the prevention of anti-money
laundering and the regulatory and self-identified
shortcomings in AML-CTF and CDD/KYC processes
that are currently subject to improvement programmes,
further significant management attention for CDD/KYC
and for improvements of the AML control framework
will be required.

Å Model risk Management
Given concerns around the quality of historic data used
for model development, the knowledge and awareness
of model use within the user environment and the
maturity of the model landscape and oversight, model
risk is elevated. Management has initiated several
programmes to address the issues in conjunction with
requirements following from upcoming regulations
and heightened regulatory expectations, e.g. in relation
to Regulatory Technical Standards, new Definition
of Default and feedback from Targeted Reviews
of Internal Models.
In addition to the significant programmes that are in place,
the above mentioned regulatory compliance risk is
mitigated by sustaining and enhancing staff awareness
with regard to regulatory programmes through ongoing
training and presentations. Additional staff and budget
have been made available to address regulatory change
initiatives. Executive management closely monitors the
progress of remediation programmes.
The Executive Board has identified and agreed upon the
following areas of improvement, which are being actively
managed by senior management:
Å The bank has to meet requirements in the field of
data aggregation and risk reporting which requires a
substantial effort. These aspects of data management,
combined with issues around data quality and data
knowledge, may result in suboptimal decision making
and business process execution, as well as elevated
model risk and missed opportunities in the application
of new technologies. Although progress has been
made in many areas, the initiatives still require a
multi-year approach in order to reach the desired level.
Å The bank values its Duty of Care towards its clients
and will continue to do so. It has programmes in place
to address issues around products sold in the past,
such as SME derivatives.
Å The complexity, accumulation and interdependencies
of the various transformation programmes, the fixing
of the foundations of the bank’s IT systems, and
various regulatory and organisational changes, entail
a risk that building blocks may not be in place within the
agreed timeframes. This may result in extra costs and
potentially in falling behind new entrants not subject to
comprehensive regulation. Alignment of these changes
and their interdependencies is a key attention point.
Å The continued increase and professionalism of external
crime threats may expose the bank and its clients
to cyber fraud attacks, ATM attacks, loan frauds and
IT disruptions. Defence mechanisms against cyber
threats are continually being upgraded. ABN AMRO has
intensified cooperation with crime-fighting authorities
and is working with authorities and other banks in
these areas of attention.
Å As a result of the accelerated use of (public) cloud
providers and the Revised Payment Services Directive
(PSD2), growing amounts of privacy-sensitive or
confidential data will be stored outside the bank.
This may impact the bank’s ability to monitor the
risk of data leaks and compliancy with the General
Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). ABN AMRO is
continually strengthening its data leak prevention
tools and controls, both internally and in liaison with
external parties involved in processing and storing
data elements.
Å The ability to attract, train and retain qualified
professionals and new talents remains a point of
attention, as this will enable the achievement of
the strategic goals. This risk is mitigated by several
programmes that focus on strategic workforce
management, culture & leadership, the use of
self-steering methods and employer branding.
Due to inherent limitations, ABN AMRO’s internal
risk management and control systems do not provide
complete assurance on the realisation of business
objectives, and cannot at all times prevent inaccuracies,
fraud and non-compliance with rules and regulations.
ABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018
Introduction Strategy and performance Risk, funding & capital Leadership Governance Annual Financial Statements Other
Risk, funding & capital / Risk, funding & capital review / Risk profile 65
The following section provides a comprehensive overview of the different risks across
business segments and portfolios. Information on capital developments is also provided.
ABN AMRO continually works to maintain a moderate risk
profile. We monitor risk against our risk appetite and
actively manage the balance sheet composition to this end. 
Risk profile assessment
Periodically, ABN AMRO assesses its risk profile in
conjunction with the bank’s risk appetite and strategic
risk appetite (SRAS). The five elements of the SRAS ensure
a coherent balance between sustainable return and value
creation, our business model, capital, and liquidity &
funding, taking into account a sound conduct, governance
and control framework. This assessment is discussed
in the Executive Board and Supervisory Board. Based on
this assessment we conclude:
Å Business model, return and value creation
There is a focus on healthy return by maintaining
long-term risk adjusted return on equity above 10%.
Limitations in the execution of the planned sustainable
growth strategies due to adverse macro-economic
and monetary conditions (i.e. sustained low/negative
interest rates) and geopolitical uncertainty (such as
the impact of Brexit, trade tensions and sanctions)
could impact global trade, thus increasing the risk for
current business and affecting our margins/revenues.
Å Capital, Liquidity & Funding
Comfortable buffers are in place to meet capital and
liquidity requirements from a regulatory and internal
(e.g. economic capital) perspective. In addition, stress
testing indicates sufficient buffers are in place for times
of stress.
Å Conduct, Governance and Control Framework
Capital buffers are in place to cover non-financial
risks. In managing these risks, we face challenges
regarding our ability to fully comply with all regulatory
requirements in 2019. Specific areas where the risk of
non-compliance with regulations requires a substantial
effort from the bank are:
Å Customer Due Diligence/KnowYourClient, Anti-Money
Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF);
Å Model management.
Regulatory compliance risk is mitigated by ensuring staff
stays aware of regulatory programmes through ongoing
training and presentations. Furthermore, additional staff
and budget have been made available for regulatory
change initiatives.
In addition, the bank has to meet requirements in the field
of data aggregation and risk reporting which requires a
substantial effort. These aspects of data management,
combined with issues regarding data quality and data
knowledge, may result in suboptimal decision making and
business process execution, as well as elevated model
risk and missed opportunities in the application of new
technologies. Although progress has been made in many
areas, the initiatives still require a multi-year approach in
order to reach the desired level. Given the balance of the
risks and mitigating actions that we have in place, our
current risk profile is considered moderate.

Balance sheet composition at 31 December 2018
Balance sheet composition
ABN AMRO is mainly active in the Dutch market and in
international operations where we have specific expertise
and hold leading positions in selective activities.
The balance sheet composition reflects the bank’s
moderate risk profile. Some characteristics that limit risk
in the balance sheet are: Å Loan portfolio matched by deposits, long-term debt and
equity;
Å Strong focus on collateralised lending; Å Limited market risk and trading portfolios; Å Moderate risk delivering attractive results and high
capital returns of at least 10%;
Å Strong capital positions reflected in a CET1 ratio
of at least 13.5%1 and a leverage ratio of at least 4%;
Å Strategic focus on limiting LtD ratio by diversifying
the funding structure and maintaining LtD at < 125%;
Å Sufficient liquidity buffers to survive 6 months of
severe stress.

Portfolio review
Total loans and advances decreased to EUR 277.3 billion
(31 December 2017: EUR 284.3 billion). The decrease was
visible in all sub-portfolios. Residential mortgage portfolio
decreased to EUR 148.9 billion (31 December 2017:
EUR 150.6 billion) mainly as a result of redemptions
outweighing new mortgage production. Corporate loans
decreased as a result of declining professional lending
activities, mainly related to the Clearing business. 
Exposure at Default
EAD increased to EUR 403.6 billion (31 December 2017:
EUR 393.6 billion). The increase was primarily the result of
higher volumes with central banks within Group Functions
and business growth within both CIB and Commercial
Banking. This was partly off-set by lower business
volumes within Retail Banking.
Regulatory capital
Total RWA decreased to EUR 105.4 billion
(31 December 2017: EUR 106.2 billion), driven by
market risk and operational risk, which was partly
offset by credit risk. The decrease in market risk was
attributable to updated market risk models combined
with a reduction of positions. Credit risk showed a
smaller increase as higher RWA due to TRIM and model
reviews was partly off-set by business movements
and asset quality developments (e.g. lower loan balances
post impairments, improved credit ratings).
Economic Capital
Economic capital (EC) decreased to EUR 15.0 billion
(31 December 2017: 15.2 billion), driven by lower market
risk in the banking book EC (EUR 0.2 billion) and a
decrease in operational risk EC (EUR 0.2 billion), which
was offset by an increase in own funds liquidity risk EC
(EUR 0.2 billion). Credit risk EC remained fairly stable
at EUR 8.0 billion (31 December 2017: EUR 7.9 billion). 
The decrease in market risk in the banking book EC and
the increase in own funds liquidity risk EC was driven by
asset liability management. The decrease in operational
risk EC resulted from model updates. The small increase
in credit risk EC related to Retail Banking.
Recent developments
The outcome of the Brexit negotiations is still uncertain
while the deadline is approaching. Our base case scenario
is still that there will not be a no-deal Brexit. As a European
bank, headquartered in Amsterdam, we have the resources,
infrastructure and contingency plans in place to ensure
the continuity of our services to clients in Europe and
beyond, whatever the outcome of the EU/UK negotiations.
ABN AMRO’s direct exposure to the UK is limited.
We have conducted a review of our clients with exposure
to the UK and have concluded that the direct exposure
of our clients is limited as well. ABN AMRO remains
committed to minimising any disruption Brexit may cause
for its clients, its activities and its staff. The impact of any
macro-economic consequences in the event of a no-deal
Brexit are uncertain. It is therefore difficult to assess the
indirect impact of Brexit on our clients and value chains.
Credit quality indicators
The credit quality indicators were impacted by the writeoff (EUR 0.4 billion) of a large part of the fully provisioned
Madoff file and by additional impairments for specific
clients in specific sectors. The write-off relating to Madoff
was recorded as all possible means of recovery had been
exhausted. Besides these developments, the credit quality
indicators performed well, in line with the performance of
the Dutch economy and housing market.
The forbearance ratio decreased as more clients
completed their probation period (i.e. were no longer
forborne), write-offs were recorded and to a lesser extent
repayments were made. The impaired and coverage ratio
decreased further as a result of clients returning to the
performing portfolio and write-offs. In addition, the past
due ratio decreased compared with year-end 2017.
Cost of risk
The cost of risk increased to 24bps for 2018 (2017: -2bps),
mainly driven by the CB and CIB portfolios. The increase
in the CB portfolio related to industrial goods and services,
healthcare and the shipping industry. The CIB portfolio
showed higher impairments, primarily related to the
energy-offshore, diamonds and shipping industries, which
were mainly the result of additional impairments for
existing impaired clients. In 2017, impairment charges
benefited from significant model releases for SME lending
and IBNI releases. For more details on impairments,
please refer to the loan impairment charges and
allowances paragraph.
Liquidity and funding
The LtD ratio decreased to 111% at 31 December 2018
(31 December 2017: 112%), mainly due to a EUR 1.8 billion
decline in the residential mortgage book and a
EUR 1.7 million decline in corporate loans.

Total Credit RWA increased to EUR 84.7 billion
(31 December 2017: EUR 84.1 billion). The RWA
increase is mainly explained by model changes driven
by TRIM and model reviews. This increase was primarily
off-set by the category Other, which includes higher
collateral values in Retail Banking and asset quality
developments (e.g. lower loan balances after impairments,
improved credit ratings) primarily in CIB. Lower business
volumes in primarily CIB and Retail Banking also offset
the increase in RWA.

1 Institutions include exposures to banks and investment undertakings, regional governments and local authorities, and pension funds. 2 Exposure at Default does not include EAD calculated for equities not held for trading and other non-credit obligations. 3 Exposure at Default does not include EAD calculated for other non-credit obligations.
The credit quality of our portfolio improved marginally,
mainly due to an increase in investment grade exposure
and a decline in impaired exposure. The increase in
investment grade exposure was mainly attributable to
governments and central banks, primarily as a result of
higher volumes with central banks within Group Functions.
In addition, corporates contributed to the higher investment
grade portfolio. The decline in impaired exposure was
mainly attributable to write-offs, repayments and to a
lesser extent clients returning to the performing portfolio. 
Credit quality by internal rating scale mapped to stages 
b
The following table presents the gross carrying amount
of loans and the contractual amount of undrawn loan
commitments, classified by internal rating and risk stage.
In order to classify a client as stage 2, several qualitative
triggers are needed, which are not necessarily dependent
on internal ratings. Reference is made to the credit risk
management section for more information on internal
ratings and stage determination.

The largest part of our portfolio is classified in the lower
range of stage 1, and to a lesser extent in the mid-range
of internal ratings. UCR 6+ is the default rating for clients
that are, for example, being revised until a new rating is
available. This applies to the majority of the data presented
in UCR 6+.
Stage 2 accounts for around 5% of the total portfolio and
spread in the mid-range of internal ratings. Further details
on credit impaired exposures, stage 3, are given in the
coverage and impaired paragraph.

The consolidated exposures in the table below have been

classified by the geographical regions where clients are
domiciled. The bank monitors and manages country risk
based on the country at risk. The country at risk may be
different from the country of domicile, for example if the
bank finances a project in a country other than the country
in which the borrower is domiciled. The bank actively
manages and monitors the development of its country

1 Institutions include exposures to banks and investment undertakings, regional governments and local authorities, and pension funds. 2 Total Exposure at Default does not include EAD calculated for equities not held for trading and other non-credit obligations. 3 Exposure at Default does not include EAD calculated for other non-credit obligations.
The bank’s portfolio is largely concentrated in the
Netherlands (71.7%). The exposure at default in the
Netherlands increased to EUR 286.9 billion (31 December
2017: EUR 284.0 billion), mainly as a result of an increase
in central governments and growth in deposits with central
banks. The increase in exposure at default in the corporates
exposure class reflects business developments at
Commercial Banking in Europe and at CIB in Europe and US.
Industry concentration
ABN AMRO applies industry concentration limits in line
with the Industry Classification Benchmark (ICB). In the
exposure table, non-material industry clusters are aggregated
under Other. Industry concentration limits are established
in the bank’s risk appetite, where the thresholds for
concentrations are based on relative risk, the importance
of the industry to the Dutch economy and expert opinion.
Industry concentration is presented both in terms of the
original obligor and in terms of the resultant obligor. The
original obligor is the counterparty with whom ABN AMRO
has the original contractual relationship, often referred to
as the borrower. The resultant obligor is the counterparty
bearing the ultimate credit risk, often referred to as the
guarantor. The industry classification of the original obligor
may differ from that of the resultant obligor, for example

in the real estate, healthcare and public administration
sectors. While government-guaranteed exposures are
included in the applicable industry in the original obligor
view, these exposures are included in public administration
in the resultant obligor view, as they concern governmentrelated exposures.

Credit risk exposures in EAD primarily related to private
individuals (non-ICB), mainly for residential mortgage loans
and, to a lesser extent, consumer loans. Private individuals
decreased modestly to EUR 175.8 billion at 31 December
2018 (31 December 2017: EUR 178.9 billion) in the resultant
obligor view. The increase in EAD is mainly explained by
an increase in public administration (non-ICB) due to higher
volumes with central banks within Group Functions.
Positions in banks decreased while positions in financial
services increased.

Collateral reporting is based on the net collateral value (NCV).
The NCV is a conservative value and represents the amount
the bank expects to recover from the collateral pledged
to the bank should the client default. Where necessary,
certain discounts are applied.
The NCV is approached by an average recovery rate
observed for the specific type of collateral and, where
applicable, by applying haircuts, for example in the event
of currency mismatches. Surplus collateral is the amount
of over-collateralisation, calculated on an individual basis.
A surplus for guarantees is not included, as the debtor
can only be liable for the maximum debt.

1 ABN AMRO classified all unsettled securities transactions as other assets and other liabilities, previously these were included in securities financing. Comparative figures have been
adjusted. 2 Other loans and advances customers consists of Government and official institutions, Financial lease receivables and Factoring. 3 Carrying amount includes Loan impairment allowances where applicable. 4 Collateral in the column Master netting agreement is mainly markets related and consists of Master netting agreements which also includes cash collateral as part of these agreements.

Total net exposure of loans and advances to customers
decreased to EUR 43.2 billion at 31 December 2018
(31 December 2017: EUR 52.9 billion). This decrease
was mainly attributable to residential mortgages
(EUR 6.4 billion) as the collateral value of property
and equipment improved due to a rise in housing
prices as well as revised recovery rates.
The total risk mitigation for consumer loans decreased
by EUR 0.4 billion, mainly due to decreased financial
instruments in Private Banking. This resulted in a modest
decrease of EUR 0.2 billion in net exposure.

Despite a modest decline of corporate loans, the total risk
mitigation for corporate loans increased to EUR 97.8 billion
(31 December 2017: EUR 92.8 billion). This increase was
mainly observed in financial instruments collateral and
largely attributable to CIB, and was partly offset by a rise
in surplus collateral. The combined effect led to a decrease
of net exposure in corporate loans.
The net exposure of other loans and advances
to customers decreased to EUR 7.3 billion
(31 December 2017: EUR 7.5 billion), mainly due
to the clearing business.

Collateral and guarantees for credit impaired assets
(stage 3) represents credit risk mitigation based on the
NCV for clients in default. The carrying amount includes
expected credit loss allowances, which is based on
the probability weighted present value of all expected
cash shortfalls over the remaining life of the financial
instrument for both on- and off-balance sheet exposures.
The Financial Restructuring & Recovery department
identifies most likely scenarios for non-programme lending
defaulted clients (going concern or gone concern) and,
by its professional judgement, amounts and timing of
expected future cash flows. This explains why a net
exposure remains after collateral pledged to the bank
has been taken into account.
During 2018, ABN AMRO obtained property and
equipment by taking possession of collateral it held as
security for loans and advances. The total amount of
such assets held on 31 December 2018 amounted to
EUR 5 million (2017: EUR 4 million). ABN AMRO does not
intend to use these assets in its operations and pursues
timely realisation of the collateral in an orderly matter.

Forborne exposures b
bk
The following table provides an overview of forborne
assets, broken down into performing and non-performing
assets, and classified by the type of forbearance measure.
Clients in (or potentially in) financial difficulty whose
contracts have been amended in ways that are considered
concessions on the part of the bank are accounted for
as forborne assets.
In 2018, the scope of non-performing assets was
extended by non-defaulted forborne positions, resulting
in approximately EUR 150 million in assets shifting from
performing to non-performing. During the third quarter of
2018, ABN AMRO changed the policy on forborne assets
by aligning the list of forbearance measures with EBA
guidelines. This change in policy resulted in exposure
shifting from temporary to permanent because of the
permanent nature of these forbearance measures.

At year-end 2018, the total amount of the forborne
portfolio had decreased to EUR 5.8 billion (2017:
EUR 7.4 billion). The decrease in forbearance is mainly
explained by a decline in corporate loans and to a lesser
extent by a decline in residential mortgages, resulting
in a forbearance ratio of 2.1% (2017: 2.6%).
The total exposure to forborne corporate loans declined
to EUR 4.5 billion (2017: EUR 5.7 billion), as a result of
contracts passing the two-year probation period (cease to
be forborne), write-offs and to a lesser extent repayments.
Forborne residential mortgages declined primarily due
to contracts which ceased to be forborne, repayments
and lower inflow of new clients.
Stage 3 forborne instruments are transferred back to
stage 2 consistently with other defaulted instruments.
Moreover, forborne financial instruments are only
transferred to stage 1 in exceptional cases after a
two-year probation period. In 2018, these transfers
amounted to around EUR 200 million.
Past due exposures
When a counterparty is past due or exceeds its credit
b
limit, all loans and advances (total gross carrying amount)
in the related credit arrangement are considered past due.
Materiality thresholds are applied for counterparties
transferring to stage 3 (EUR 500 for programme lending
and EUR 5,000 for non-programme lending). Below these
thresholds, amounts are reported as >90 days past due.

Past due exposure on loans and advances to customers
declined to EUR 3.6 billion (2017: EUR 4.0) due to
a decrease in short-term arrears (≤ 30 days), which
was partly offset by an increase in mid-term arrears.
From a sub-portfolio view, residential mortgages benefited
mostly from the decrease in short-term arrears. Corporate
loans recorded an inflow related to a few relatively large
CIB and Commercial Banking clients in the shipping
and real estate industry. For other loans and advances
to customers, there was an increases in all of the time
buckets. This portfolio includes the bank’s lease activities,
where past due exposures can fluctuate strongly due to
business characteristics. Overall, these developments
resulted in past due ratio improving to 1.3% at year-end
2018.

In the analysis below, the data from 31 December 2018
figures was compared with the data from 31 December
2017, although the basis of presentation was different
as a result of the implementation of IFRS 9. Comparative
figures as at 1 January 2018 are included in the IFRS 9
transitional disclosures under note 1, Accounting policies.
The IAS 39 impaired ratio has been compared with the
IFRS 9 stage 3 ratio, because the impaired assets under
IAS 39 have been classified as stage 3 assets under IFRS
9. The IAS 39 coverage ratio was calculated by dividing
the amount of allowances by the impaired exposure.
Under IFRS 9, 93% of the loans and advances relates
to stage 1 and 4.9% to stage 2.
The stage 3 impaired ratio improved and the coverage
ratio decreased for loans and advances to customers at
year-end 2018. The coverage ratio was impacted by a large
write-off for the fully provisioned Madoff file, which was
offset by additional provisions mainly for existing impaired
clients in specific industries. If the Madoff file had not
been written off, the stage 3 coverage ratio would have
increased to 36.2% at year-end 2018.
Residential mortgages and consumer loans benefited
from the strong Dutch economic environment, recording
lower impaired exposures and lower allowances for
credit losses, resulting in improved stage 3 ratios and
lower coverage ratios for stage 3.
Impaired corporate loans declined as a result of write-offs
and repayments. The decrease in credit loss allowances
was partly offset by additional credit losses for specific,
mainly existing, impaired files in the energy offshore,
diamonds and shipping industries in CIB. Additional
credit losses were recognised in Commercial Banking
for the healthcare and shipping industries.

Impairment charges amounted to EUR 655 million in 2018
(2017: EUR 63 million release). These charges related
mainly to specific files in the stage 3 corporate loans
portfolio, resulting in a cost of risk of 24bps (2017:
cost of risk -2bps). The increase in impairments mainly
related to CIB and Commercial Banking.
Commercial Banking recorded net additions of
EUR 253 million in 2018, compared with a net release
of EUR 179 million in 2017, mainly reflecting impairment
charges in industrial goods & services, healthcare and
shipping. The remainder was spread across various
industry sectors. The release in 2017 was largely
attributable to model refinement and update, compared
with limited releases in 2018.
Impairments charges in CIB increased to EUR 427 million
(2017: EUR 219 million). The increase was mainly the
result of additional impairments for existing files in the
energy (mainly off-shore), diamonds, shipping and
commodities industries. Additionally, we executed a few
secondary sales of our most vulnerable clients in 2018,
which materially mitigated our downside risk in the
offshore energy market.
Residential mortgages continued to benefit from the
strong Dutch economy and housing market, resulting in
a release of EUR 11 million (2017: EUR 49 million release).
The release in 2017 was significantly impacted by a model
refinement and IBNI releases.
Consumer loans recorded a limited release of EUR 4 million,
compared with a release of EUR 54 million in 2017.
Overall, our cost of risk (COR) was 24bps for 2018, below
the through-the-cycle COR of 25-30bps and in line with
our expectations.

The largest decline in the forborne exposure in 2018 was
recorded in the Netherlands and related to decreases in
Commercial Banking and Retail Banking, which benefited
from the strong domestic economy. The decreases in
Asia, USA and the rest of the world were primarily due
to the outflow of some large individual files that ceased
to be forborne in combination with and several write-offs.
The forborne exposures in the Netherlands decreased
mainly as a result of improvements in residential
mortgages, reflecting the strong performance of
the Dutch economy and housing market. In addition,
the rest of the world and the rest of Europe showed
a decrease in forborne exposure.
Credit impaired exposures and allowances for credit
losses dropped significantly in the rest of the world,
mainly due to the write-off (EUR 0.4 billion) of the fully
provisioned Madoff file. Rest of the world and USA were
also impacted by write-offs and secondary market sales.
Credit impaired exposures in the Netherlands decreased
due to write-offs and repayments.

Forborne assets mainly declined in private individuals and
in the oil and gas industry. The decline in private individuals
was driven by lower forborne exposures in residential
mortgages, while the decline in oil and gas related to
a combination of write-offs and contracts passing the
probation period. Increases in forborne basic resources
related to the diamonds sector.
At industry level, loans past due but not stage 3 declined
largely for private individuals, reflecting the strong
performance of the Dutch economy and housing market.
In addition, the oil and gas industry showed a decrease,
offset by increases in food and beverage.
Credit impaired (stage 3) exposures declined due to a
combination of write offs, secondary market sales and
repayments. This was mainly visible in financial services,
due to a significant write-off related to Madoff, which was
fully provisioned. In addition, oil and gas decreased due to
the secondary market sales. Private individuals decreased
in line with the performance of the Dutch economy and
housing market.
Developments in specific portfolios
The following section provides a more detailed overview
of developments in specific portfolios and products.
Residential mortgages
The Dutch housing market was buoyant and prices
continued to rise. The housing price index published by
Statistics Netherlands (CBS) for 2018 was 8.4% higher
than in 2017.
The overall price level in December 2018 was 4.7% above
the former record level set in August 2008, not corrected
for inflation. As a result of the shortage in housing stock,
the number of housing transactions was still under
pressure, both in existing and new residential buildings in
almost all provinces in the Netherlands. This was reflected
in the total number of transactions in the Dutch housing
market, which was 9.7% lower than in 2017, according
to Statistics Netherlands.
The number of transactions also trended down as
elevated price levels impacted the affordability of homes.
There was also less demand from people who had
postponed their home purchase plans during the crisis,
as the majority of them had already moved. The shortage
in housing stock was partly the result of home movers
preferring to buy a new home before putting their current
property up for sale.

1 The RWA and Exposure at Default amounts are based on the exposure class Secured by immovable property. This scope is slightly broader than the residential mortgage portfolio. 2 Annualised impairment charges on loans and advances customers for the period divided by the average loans and advances customers on the basis of gross carrying amount and excluding
fair value adjustment from hedge accounting.
The residential mortgage portfolio decreased by 1.2% to
EUR 148.8 billion (31 December 2017: EUR 150.6 billion)
as redemptions exceeded new production of mortgage
loans. ABN AMRO’s market share in new mortgage
production ended lower at 16.8% (2017: 21.0%). The
proportion of amortising mortgages continued to increase,
totalling 29% at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017:
24%). Total redemptions were 2.9% higher in 2018 than in
2017. Contractual redemptions gradually increased, in line
with changes in the portfolio composition. In 2018, extra
repayments amounted to EUR 2.3 billion and so remained
fairly stable compared with 2017.
Mortgages covered by the National Mortgage Guarantee
scheme (NHG) came down to 24%, modestly lower
compared with 31 December 2017 (2017: 26%).

Regulatory capital
The RWA for the residential mortgage portfolio decreased
to EUR 16.9 billion (2017: EUR 17.2 billion). Exposure at
default (EAD) decreased to EUR 162.8 billion (2017:
EUR 165.1 billion). The decline in RWA was the combined
result of a decrease in EAD, improved credit quality, higher
collateral values and lower amounts in arrears. The decrease
in EAD was mainly due to lower business volumes.
Credit quality indicators
Credit quality indicators for residential mortgages
improved, in line with the performance of the Dutch
economy and housing market. The past due ratio
decreased, mainly due to a limited inflow into past
due exposures in short-term arrears. The coverage
ratio decreased as a result of improved credit quality,
higher collateral values and a decrease in impaired
stage 3 exposures.

1 ABN AMRO calculates the Loan-to-Market Value using the indexation of the CBS (Statistics Netherlands). 2 NHG guarantees.
Rising housing prices and restrictions set for the
maximum loan to market value (LtMV) of new mortgages
have led to continued improvement of the average
indexed LtMV, both guaranteed and unguaranteed.
The long-term LtMV of the bank’s portfolio is expected
to decrease further as a combined result of rising housing
prices, contractual and extra redemptions, and current
tax regulations.
The gross carrying amount of mortgages with a LtMV
in excess of 100% declined significantly, totalling
EUR 3.5 billion at year-end 2018 (31 December 2017:
EUR 11.8 billion). Note that LtMVs in excess of 100%
do not necessarily indicate that these clients are in
financial difficulties. However, ABN AMRO actively
approaches clients with an interest-only mortgage in
combination with a high LtMV level to discuss a change
in their mortgage product. Mortgages with a LtMV>100%
account for 2.4% of total mortgages and approximately
5% of the extra repayments related to this category.

ABN AMRO proactively approaches clients with an
interest-only and/or life (investment) mortgage to inform
them about their product in the current and the future
situation. If necessary, ABN AMRO discusses adjustments
to the mortgage to make it better suited to what the
client needs.
Commercial Real Estate (CRE)
The Dutch commercial real estate (investment) market
continued to increase in 2018, driven by high demand
from investors. After Germany, the United Kingdom
and France, the Netherlands attracted most investors
in commercial real estate. A total of EUR 20 billion was
invested in 2018, an increase of 2.6% compared with
2017. Due to ongoing low interest rates, a significant part
of the investment budget has shifted towards commercial
real estate. As fewer investment opportunities are available,
the increase in volume is slowing down. Demand for
office space is still increasing and the availability of highquality locations is diminishing. Although new construction
is growing, a lack of building sites at locations with high
demand is causing lease prices for offices to rise.
The industrial market continued to benefit from the
high economic growth in the Netherlands and its central
location in European logistics. Demand for locations
was driven by rising e-commerce sales, increasing exports
and fear of a logistical chaos due to Brexit.
In 2018, residential assets were the biggest investment
in the Netherlands, the first time ever. The residential
market is in high demand due to increasing housing
prices, lack of new build and changing preferences of
inhabitants. Urbanisation is causing rents to increase
most in the largest cities in the Netherlands, but due
to shortage in the housing market, rental fees in other
parts of the Netherlands increased as well.
Commercial Real Estate portfolio
In 2018 the EAD increased 13% to EUR 10.6 billion
compared with year-end 2017. The credit quality indicators
in 2018 further improved due to the strong commercial
real estate market. However, the coverage ratio in 2018
went up to 44% (31 December 2017: 35%) as impaired
exposures showed a sharper decline than allowances for
impairments. The CRE LtV continued to decline, totalling
49.7% (2017: 53.5%) mainly as a result of rising commercial
real estate prices, which are largely based on Dutch
properties. The loan portfolio consisted mainly of
investment loans that were well diversified across
different asset types.

1 ABN AMRO classified all unsettled securities transactions as other assets and other liabilities, previously these were included in securities financing. Comparative figures have been adjusted.
Activities in the trading book are sensitive to multiple risk
factors. Most assets and liabilities in the banking book are
sensitive to interest rate risk to a large extent. Some of
the assets and liabilities are also sensitive to FX risk;
however, ABN AMRO minimises this risk through hedging.
Market risk in the banking book
Market risk in the banking book is the risk that the bank’s
value or income declines because of unfavourable market
movements. The market risk in the banking book consists
predominantly of interest rate risk, which arises from
holding loans with interest rate maturities that are different
from the interest rate maturities of the deposits. The
assets have a longer average maturity than the liabilities.
This applies to contractual as well as behavioural maturities.
ABN AMRO uses a combination of portfolio (macro)
hedges and specific asset or liability (micro) hedges
to swap fixed interest rates for floating interest rate
positions. The resulting interest rate positions, after
application of interest rate hedges, are in line with
the bank’s strategy and risk appetite.
Interest rate risk metrics
ABN AMRO uses NII-at-Risk and duration as the main
metrics for managing the interest rate risk.
ABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018
Introduction Strategy and performance Risk, funding & capital Leadership Governance Annual Financial Statements Other
Risk, funding & capital / Risk, funding & capital review / Market risk 97
NII-at-Risk
NII-at-Risk is the difference in net interest income (NII)
between a base scenario and four alternative scenarios.
It is defined as the worst outcome of the following
scenarios: gradual increase or decrease in interest rates
by 200bps and instantaneous increase or decrease of
100bps. All scenarios are measured over a time horizon
of one year. NII-at-Risk covers all expected cash flows,
including commercial margins and other spread components,
from interest-rate-sensitive assets and liabilities and
off-balance sheet items in the banking book. A floor
of -100bps on market rates as well as a floor of 0bps
on retail deposits is applied.
Duration
Duration of equity measures value changes resulting from
minor parallel shifts of the yield curve. The computation of
duration is based on a comparison between a base curve
and the change in the economic value of a portfolio due
to an interest rate increase/decrease. We also measure
the value sensitivity to changes in individual maturities
on the yield curve.
The following table shows the interest rate risk metrics
at year-end 2018 and 2017.
31 December 2018 31 December 2017
NII-at-risk (in %) -1.3 -0.5
Duration of equity (in years) 1.4 2.2
The risk appetite for interest rate risk was lowered in
the annual review of the risk appetite statement for 2018,
while also anticipating a periodic methodology review
and stricter regulatory testing (supervisory outlier test).
In addition, the way non-maturing deposits are modelled
has been updated to ensure accurate measurement
and management of interest rate risk. Duration of equity
decreased from 2.2 to 1.4 years. Although duration of
equity increased due to business developments and
the updated non-maturing deposits model, the effect
was more than offset by active hedging of the portfolio.
The NII-at-Risk at year-end 2018 increased to -1.3%
(approximately EUR -67 million), reflecting the impact
on NII in the scenario of an instantaneous decrease in
interest rates of 100bps. Prior to 2018, NII-at-Risk only
included the scenarios of a gradual increase and decrease
in interest rates of 200bps. The NII-at-Risk for 2017
(-0.5%) reflected a reduction of NII in the scenario of a
gradual decrease in interest rates. For comparison, the
impact of a gradual decrease in interest rates amounted
to -0.4% at year-end 2018.
The highest NII occurs for the scenario where interest
rates rise gradually by 200bps, in which NII would increase
by 7.2% (approximately EUR 366 million).
Market risk in the trading book
Market risk exposure
ABN AMRO applies a diversified portfolio VaR approach,
d
which takes into account the fact that returns across risk
factors may offset one another to a certain extent and
consequently reduce risk. As long as these returns are
not perfectly correlated to one another, VaR figures based
on a diversified portfolio approach will be lower than if the
figures are calculated using undiversified VaR. Undiversified
VaR means that the VaR figures computed for the different
risk factors are summed up without taking into account
any offset across risk factors, and therefore negates the
potential for risk reduction.
The following graph shows the total VaR (‘VaR diversified’)
and aggregation of the stand-alone risk factors
(‘VaR undiversified’).

ABN AMRO has provisioned for litigation of historical
claims against the bank. These claims are accounted for
in the balance sheet under provisions (more information
on provisions is included in note 29 to the Consolidated
Annual Financial Statements). The figures below show the
operational risk losses without provisions for litigation and

We made further payments for cases for which large
provisions for litigation were made in previous years,
such as SME derivatives-related issues. These payments
are included in clients, products and business practices.
External legal expenses relating to the handling of claims
are also accounted for in this category. In the same
category, a provision has been made for additional costs
of accelerating CDD remediation programmes in Retail
Banking (ICS) and Commercial Banking (See note 29
Provisions of the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements
for further information). The majority of losses in the
external fraud category were relatively small. Most of
the small external fraud losses involved card-related fraud.
Costs incurred for ATM attacks are also recorded as
external fraud. The net loss for execution, delivery and
process management consists of small processing errors.
Cybercrime
Cyberattacks are growing in severity and risk, organised by
criminal groups and/or activists. We therefore continuously
mitigate these risks to prevent security breaches from
occurring. An increasing number of DDoS attacks were
launched against the bank in the past year. These kinds
of attacks do not reach our customer data, but occupy a
bandwidth of resources with the aim of denying services
to our clients. New technology for DDoS prevention
was successfully implemented. With our transition to
open banking (PSD2), customer data (e.g. transactions,
balances) can be aggregated and transferred, stored and
used in the infrastructure of a third party. This is associated
with an increased risk profile for ABN AMRO’s cyber
security, as it increases the attack surface and therefore
also the potential threats.
As we continued to strengthen our security controls
in 2018, losses were low despite the persistent volume
of attacks. However, operational losses resulting from
external fraud through digital client channels were higher
in 2018 than in 2017. Compared with 2012 (baseline: 100),
the level of fraud losses in 2018 was 10 (2017: 8, 2016: 4,
2015: 7). The volume of phishing, malware and card theft
attacks increased in 2018 compared with 2017. Besides
a strong central CISO team, all bank employees need to
know how to deal with information security risks. To this
end, an awareness campaign to enhance knowledge on
managing different kinds of attacks was launched at all
levels within the Bank.
Business continuity
Business continuity management is part of the risk
management framework and embedded in the
organisation by first-line-of-defence roles within
businesses and support functions, subsidiaries and
countries and a second-line-of-defence function within
the corporate BCM department. Business continuity
mitigation controls, such as business continuity plans,
crisis management, business relocation plans and IT
disaster recovery plans are in place to prepare and deal
with incidents and crises threatening the continuity of
critical business processes. In the years to come, the
improvement of business continuity will focus mainly
on meeting the requirements of the ISO 22301 standard,
implementation of scenario-based response, and
automation of the crisis management support process.
During 2018, our crisis management organisation proved
to be able to respond adequately on all occasions, restoring
business processes according to requirements and
minimising the total event loss amount. Evaluations
and root cause analyses were executed to analyse and
implement lessons learned.
Stability of digital services
Availability of the bank’s internet banking services during
prime time was 99.46% on average in 2018, compared
to 99.68% in 2017. This figure was impacted by the DDoS
attacks in Q1 2018. The last quarter of 2018, however,
we measured availability of 99.86%.

Liquidity risk management
The objective of ABN AMRO’s liquidity management is
to manage the bank’s liquidity position and to comply
at all times with internal, regulatory and other relevant
liquidity requirements. Various indicators are used to
measure the liquidity objectives.

Loan-to-Deposit ratio 111% 112%
The survival period reflects the period that the liquidity
position is expected to remain positive in an internally
developed (moderate) stress scenario. This scenario
assumes wholesale funding markets deteriorate and
retail, private and corporate clients withdraw part of their
deposits. The survival period was consistently >12 months
in 2018. The liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) and the net
stable funding ratio (NSFR) both remained above 100%
throughout 2018.

1 The mandatory cash reserve with the central bank has been deducted from the cash and central bank deposits in the liquidity buffer.
The liquidity buffer consists largely of cash and deposits at
central banks, government bonds and retained issuances.
Most of the securities in the liquidity buffer, with the
exception of retained RMBS and retained covered bonds,
qualify for the LCR. Furthermore, both the liquidity buffer
and the LCR buffer face haircuts based on their market
value. These haircuts are used to determine the liquidity
value. Haircuts may differ between the two buffers as
the internal assessment of the liquidity buffer may deviate
from the LCR definition. The liquidity buffer increased by
EUR 12.0 billion to EUR 84.5 billion at 31 December 2018
(31 December 2017: EUR 72.5 billion). This increase is
linked to volatility of short-term business lines and active
liquidity management. Government bonds increased by
EUR 4.9 billion, mostly due to the further strengthening
of the USD liquidity buffer.

Maturity calendar
We enhance the maturity profile of our long-term funding
ba
predominantly by spreading redemptions of funding
instruments over time. The average maturity of newly
issued funding increased to 7.5 years, (up from 7.2 years
in 2017). The average maturity of outstanding long-term
funding increased to 5.2 years at year-end 2018 (up from
5.1 years at year-end 2017). This was mainly the result of
the issuance of covered bonds with 15-20 year tenors.
These long tenors reflect the composition of new mortgage
origination, which has shifted to mortgages with longer
fixed interest rate periods.
The maturity calendar assumes redemption on the earliest
possible call date or the legal maturity date, which does
not mean that the instruments will be called at the earliest
possible call date. Early redemption of subordinated
instruments is subject to approval by the regulator.
The Targeted Long-Term Refinancing Operations (TLTRO)
II of EUR 8.0 billion is reported at the legal maturity of
four years, although there is a voluntary repayment option
after two years.

Main developments in capital position
At 31 December 2018, the Basel III phase-in Common
q
Equity Tier 1 (CET1), Tier 1 and total capital ratios were
18.4%, 19.3% and 22.2% respectively. The capital position
strengthened compared with 31 December 2017,
driven by profit accumulation and a net RWA decrease.
All capital ratios were well above the regulatory minimum
requirements, and in line with the bank’s risk appetite
and strategic ambitions. At year-end 2018, the fullyloaded Basel IV CET1 ratio improved to around 13.5%
(pre-mitigations). We are developing mitigating actions
to maintain performance under Basel IV and to further
reduce the Basel IV RWA impact. This is expected to
mitigate approximately 1/5th of the Basel IV RWA inflation
and will raise the estimated Basel IV CET1 ratio above
14% (post-mitigation). In addition to mitigating actions,
we are also looking at pricing, new business models
and reducing capital intensive activities. We aim to
meet the fully-loaded Basel IV CET1 requirement early
in the phase-in period, i.e. >13.5%.
The following chart shows the primary drivers of the Basel III
capital ratios in 2018.

Our CET1 capital target range under Basel III was 17.5-18.5%
for 2018 and has been reconfirmed for 2019. This consists
of a prudent Basel IV implementation buffer of 4-5% CET1
on top of our Supervisory Review and Evaluation Process
(SREP) capital requirement, Pillar 2 guidance and the
management buffer (totalling 13.5%). ABN AMRO reviews
the buffer and the capital target annually to reflect possible
capital developments such as TRIM and Basel IV. The
target for return on average equity (10-13%) remains
unchanged under Basel IV.
At year-end 2018, RWAs included the effects of TRIM and
model reviews including Clearing. We expect regulatory
headwinds from capital regulations, the industry-wide
Non-Performing Exposure (NPE) guidance and model
reviews (including TRIM), partly offset by progress on the
CIB refocus. In particular, we expect further increase in
RWAs in respect of Clearing during 2019 reflecting results
of model review. TRIM is the regulatory assessment and
harmonisation of internal RWA models whereas NPE aims
to ensure the harmonisation of impairment provisioning
across EU banks. TRIM is not expected to materially

impact Basel IV fully-loaded RWAs, whereas NPE could
impact both Basel III and Basel IV CET1 ratios and the
leverage ratio.
Developments impacting capital ratios in 2018
Common Equity Tier 1 capital
q
CET1 capital increased in 2018 primarily as a result
of profit accumulation, while net profit attributable to
shareholders amounted to EUR 2,286 million. Net profit
after dividend allocation is included in CET1 capital, in
accordance with regulations and the dividend policy.
Based on the final SREP, the full phase-in of the systematic
risk buffer (from 2.25% in 2018 to 3.0% in 2019) and the
capital conservation buffer (from 1.88% in 2018 to 2.5%
in 2019), the SREP requirement increased from 10.45% in
2018 to 11.82% in 2019, including a counter-cyclical buffer
of 0.07%. The maximum distributable amount (MDA)
trigger level for ABN AMRO Bank N.V. has become 11.82%
of CET1 capital, to be increased by any additional tier 1
(AT1) or tier 2 capital shortfall. Due to the minority interest
rules interpretation of the EBA, there was an AT1 shortfall
of 0.6% at year-end 2018, as ABN AMRO Group N.V.
cannot incorporate all its available AT1 capital. However,
the CET1 ratio is comfortably above the MDA trigger level.
The revised minority interest rule typically impacts on
bank holding companies with a single subsidiary and a
high level of total capital, as is the case for ABN AMRO.
It implies that the portion of outstanding AT1 and T2
instruments issued by ABN AMRO Bank N.V. (the
resolution entity) in excess of the minimum own
funds requirement (excluding the SRB) can no longer
fully contribute to the consolidated capital ratios of
ABN AMRO Group.
On our Investor Day in November 2018, ABN AMRO
announced it would explore the simplification of its
corporate structure by merging ABN AMRO Group with
ABN AMRO Bank. The Bank is making further preparations
to proceed with this legal merger, which will require
regulatory approval and the consent of several stakeholders.
A legal merger will result in simplification of our organisation
and financial benefits (lower costs and higher regulatory
capital ratios). The simplification of the corporate structure
removes the AT1 shortfall and is beneficial to the Tier 1,
total capital and leverage ratio at the Group consolidated
level, as the EBA interpretation for minority interest rules
no longer applies.
Additional Tier 1
A total of EUR 2.0 billion of AT1 instruments is currently
outstanding. The AT1 instruments have triggers at the
Group level (7% CET1), Bank sub-consolidated level
(5.125% CET1) and Bank solo level (5.125% CET1). If
the CET1 ratio breaks through the trigger level, the AT1
is temporarily written down. ABN AMRO is comfortably
above the trigger levels, with the Group level CET1 ratio
at 18.4%, the Bank sub-consolidated CET1 ratio at 18.4%
and the Bank solo CET1 ratio at 17.2%. Available distributable
items (ADI) at 31 December 2018 totalled EUR 18.5 billion.
Tier 2 capital
The phase-in total capital ratio (22.2%) increased by
0.9 percentage points compared to 31 December 2017
due to profit accumulation and an RWA decrease, partly
offset by the effect of the minority interest rule.
Risk-weighted assets
Total RWA decreased by EUR 0.8 billion to EUR 105.4 billion
at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: EUR 106.2 billion).
This decrease was primarily driven by market risk and
operational risk, partly offset by credit risk. More information
on RWA is provided in the Risk section of this report.
Further information on share capital, dividend
and capital instruments
Share capital
The share capital remained unchanged in 2018. At
31 December 2017, the authorised share capital amounted
to EUR 4,700 million, distributed as 4,500 million class A
ordinary shares and 200 million class B ordinary shares.
Class A and B ordinary shares have a nominal value of
EUR 1.00 each.
At 31 December 2018, issued and paid-up capital amounted
to EUR 940 million and consisted of 940 million class A
ordinary shares. Further information is provided in note 32
to the Annual Financial Statements.
Dividend
From 2018 onwards, the dividend payout has been set
at 50% of net sustainable profit attributable to owners
of the parent company, excluding exceptional items that
significantly distort profitability. Additional distributions,
which can either be special dividends or share buy-backs
(subject to regulatory approval), will be considered if
capital is within or above the target range and will be
subject to other circumstances, including regulatory and
commercial considerations. The combined distribution
will be at least 50% of sustainable profit.
ABN AMRO proposes a final cash dividend of
EUR 752 million, representing EUR 0.80 per share and
reflecting an additional distribution of EUR 260 million
on top of the 50% payout ratio. Together with the interim
cash dividend of EUR 611 million, this will bring the total
dividend for 2018 to EUR 1,363 million or EUR 1.45 per
share. This brings the payout ratio to 62% of sustainable
profit after deduction of AT1 coupon payments and
minority interests and reflects a 12% additional
distribution. In 2017, the payout ratio was 50% with
a EUR 1.45 dividend per share, or EUR 1.363 million,

of which EUR 611 million (EUR 0.65 per share) was

was final dividend.
We expect continuing capital generation and are well
placed to consider additional distributions in excess of
the targeted 50% payout. However, we will continue
to take a prudent approach to additional distributions
reflecting commercial and regulatory developments.
In 2019, our dividend provision in CET1 will be 62%
of net profit attributable to shareholders, in line with
applicable regulation setting out that this should be
at least equal to the 2018 payout ratio.

Main regulatory developments 
CRD IV and CRR came into full effect on 1 January 2019.
Further to this, the European Commission issued draft
texts in November 2016 to amend CRD IV/CRR/BRRD,
which include the changes to the leverage ratio and MREL
mentioned hereafter. The EU legislative bodies are
currently discussing finalisation of these proposals.
The Basel Committee has set the implementation date at
1 January 2022, from which date the output floor will be
gradually phased-in over a period of 5 years. Basel IV will
significantly impact ABN AMRO’s portfolio. Based on yearend 2018 figures, the assessment indicates a potential
increase of RWA of around 36% when applying a 72.5%
floor. The calculations could still contain uncertainties,
as a number of assumptions are made on how Basel IV
standards will be applied. The potential impact may differ,
depending on the implementation into European law and
regulations. The assessment is based on a static balance
sheet and does not take into account management
actions. We aim to meet the fully-loaded Basel IV CET1
requirement early in the phase-in period, i.e. 13.5%.

The CRR fully-loaded CET1 ratio at 31 December 2018
was 18.4%, which was equal to the CRR phase-in CET1
ratio. Under the CRD IV/CRR fully-loaded rules, RWA
are equivalent to those under the phase-in rules. The
amount of CET1 capital under the fully-loaded rules is
approximately equal to the amount under the phase-in
rules, since the fully-loaded impact on CET1 capital
deductions is largely neutral. The CRR fully-loaded total
capital ratio at 31 December 2018 was 22.1%, which was
slightly lower than the CRR phase-in total capital ratio of
22.2%. In 2018, the fully-loaded ratio was lower than the
phase-in ratio, as the revised EBA Q&A rule on minority

than on the ratio under the fully-loaded rules.

The CRR introduced a non-risk-based leverage ratio that
is expected to become a binding measure with effect
from 2021. ABN AMRO aims for a leverage ratio of at
least 4%. At 31 December 2018, the fully-loaded leverage
ratio of ABN AMRO Group increased slightly to 4.2%,
(31 December 2017: 4.1%) reflecting a decrease of the
exposure measure, resulting mainly from balance sheet
management and seasonal effects.
ABN AMRO expects a change in the methodology for
calculating the exposure measure. The Basel Committee
on Banking Supervision and the Council of Finance
Ministers of the European Union (ECOFIN) both reached
agreement on the use of the SA-CCR calculation
methodology for clearing guarantees, providing further
confidence that this will be applicable via CRR2 in 2021
at the earliest. ABN AMRO estimates that the cumulative
CRR2 adjustments including SA-CCR would decrease
the exposure measure by approximately EUR 53.5 billion,
which would improve the fully-loaded leverage ratio by
0.6% percentage points to 4.8%. ABN AMRO continues
to monitor and report the leverage ratio as being at least
4%, based on the current CEM methodology.
The potential merger between ABN AMRO Bank and Group
will improve the leverage ratio with 0.2 percentage points,
as the regulation for minority interest will no longer apply.

The exposure measure is reported to the Asset and
Liability Committee (ALCO) at business line level and
monitored closely in order to ensure the leverage ratio
remains within the bank’s risk appetite. The leverage ratio
outlook takes into account business specific plans as well
as (macro) economic conditions, regulatory developments
and capital related uncertainties. In the event of risk
appetite breaches for the leverage ratio, the bank-wide
escalation paths for capital and funding are followed.

1 Other MREL eligible liabilities consists of subordinated liabilities that are not included in regulatory capital. 2 MREL is calculated as total regulatory capital plus other MREL eligible subordinated liabilities divided by total risk-weighted assets.
The minimum requirement for own funds and eligible
liabilities (MREL) aims to ensure that banks in the
European Union have sufficient capacity to absorb
losses in the event of a potential bank failure. The Single
Resolution Board (SRB) has set requirements for
ABN AMRO Bank at the consolidated level in line
with a Single Point of Entry resolution strategy.
The binding MREL requirement is set at 8.91% (including
senior debt) of total liabilities and own funds (TLOF),
equalling EUR 32.9 billion and 31.55% of RWA for 2018.
Taking into account MREL eligible senior debt, ABN AMRO
currently exceeds this requirement. At the end of 2018, a
bill was passed in the Dutch Parliament and Senate which
introduces a new category of MREL eligible debt to the
creditor hierarchy, called senior non-preferred. ABN AMRO
has an MREL ambition of 29.3% of RWA for year-end 2019,
to be met with own funds subordinated instruments and
senior non-preferred instruments.

Advice on increased sustainability risk
Certain industries face more sustainability risks than
others and the nature of the risks they face can also vary.
Our Sustainable Banking department provides advice on
clients operating in industries with a higher sustainability
risk. The following graphs present a breakdown of advice
given for each industry as well as the type of advice
and conclusions.

The number of cases in which the Sustainability Banking
department provided advice decreased by 65 to 472
in 2018. This decrease was caused by the transfer of
responsibility for non-complex mostly client acceptance
files to other risk departments. The number of times the
Sustainable Banking department gave advice related to
our lending activities increased by 49 to 215 in 2018.
Lending activities require a more extensive sustainability
assessment than client acceptance. For lending activities,
specific policy requirements apply to seven sectors.
Furthermore, each sector is divided into multiple
sub-sectors and activities at different places in the
supply chain.
The types of advice and conclusions are presented below.
The 472 cases for which advice was given in 2018 included
28 rejected cases and 191 approved cases. In 251 cases,
approval was subject to certain conditions, which is a
significant increase on 2017. The conditions range from
requesting additional information to engagement aimed
at realising substantial improvements in sustainability
performance.

Effectiveness of sustainability risk management
We believe that we are in control of our sustainability risk.
Approximately 6% of the advice was negative in 2018.
First-line relationship managers are aware of the bank’s
sustainability risk policies and predominantly submit credit
applications that comply with these policies. In addition,
we further developed our framework and performed
sustainability assessments for more than 3,202 transactions
in 2018, using the Global Sustainability Risk Index (GSRI)
tool. We assessed 2,273 of these transactions, mainly
regarding CIB clients, for compliance with our ESE standards,
as they involved a higher level of sustainability risk. ESG/
ESE criteria are used in sustainability assessments to assess
clients’ ethical, social, environmental and/or governance
risks, their conduct or the entities they invest in.

This section presents ABN AMRO’s leadership and corporate governance framework.
It includes information on the Executive Board, Executive Committee and Supervisory
Board, as well as on the legal structure and remuneration policy. Additionally it
presents the Report of the Supervisory Board for 2018.
Introduction to
Leadership & governance
ABN AMRO’s management structure includes an
Executive Board at both ABN AMRO Group and
ABN AMRO Bank level and an Executive Committee at
ABN AMRO Bank level. On 1 March 2018, the Supervisory
Board appointed Mr Christian Bornfeld as a member of the
Executive Board and Chief Innovation & Technology Officer
to succeed Mr Johan van Hall, who resigned on that same
date. No other changes in the Executive Committee were
made during 2018.
Role and responsibilities of the Executive Board
The Executive Board is the managing board of
ABN AMRO Group and ABN AMRO Bank within the
meaning of Section 2:129 of the Dutch Civil Code and
is responsible for (i) the general course of business of
ABN AMRO, for ensuring compliance with laws and
regulations and for the adequate financing of its activities;
(ii) the continuity of ABN AMRO and its business; and
(iii) setting ABN AMRO’s mission, vision, strategy, risk
appetite, corporate standards and values, risk framework,
main policies, budgets, financial and non-financial targets,
and for the realisation thereof. In respect of these duties,
and to the extent they relate to ABN AMRO Bank and its
subsidiaries, the Executive Board consults the Executive
Committee, without prejudice to the Executive Board’s
statutory collective management responsibilities.
The Executive Board is also required to consult the
Executive Committee regarding the strategic direction
of the bank (see next paragraph).
The Executive Board ensures close cooperation with the
Supervisory Board in the discharge of its responsibilities
and seeks the approval of the Supervisory Board for the
bank-wide strategy (in line with the pursued culture aimed
at long-term value creation) and targets. The Executive
Board is accountable to the Supervisory Board and to
the General Meeting for the performance of its duties.
In performing its duties, the Executive Board develops
a view on long-term value creation for ABN AMRO and
its business and takes into account the relevant
stakeholder interests.
Role and responsibilities of the Executive Committee
The Executive Committee is part of ABN AMRO Bank’s
‘management body’ (together with the Executive Board
and the Supervisory Board) as defined in CRD IV and has
duties and responsibilities based upon delegation by the
Executive Board. The Executive Committee is entrusted
with the effective direction of ABN AMRO Bank and the
subsidiaries and is specifically mandated to ensure the
translation of ABN AMRO’s mission, vision, strategy,
policies, annual budget, risk appetite, standards and
values, financial and other non-financial targets into
specific group aligned strategies, policies, budgets, risk
appetites, standards and performance targets for each
business line, with the aim to contribute to long-term
value creation by ABN AMRO and to build and maintain
the culture that is required for that purpose. The respective
members of the Executive Committee are also
responsible for the daily management of their own
business lines.

Executive Committee
Introduction to Leadership & governance Executive Board and Executive Committee
ABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018
Introduction Strategy and performance Risk, funding & capital Leadership Governance Annual Financial Statements Other
Leadership & governance / Introduction to Leadership & governance 125
In addition, the Executive Committee contributes to the
definition of the strategic direction of the bank: the
Executive Board is required to consult the Executive
Committee in respect of any decisions with regard to the
bank’s (i) mission, vision and strategy, and (ii) risk policies,
risk appetite framework and statement. The Executive
Committee ensures an open dialogue with the
Supervisory Board, both on specific issues and in general,
in order to inform the Supervisory Board adequately. The
Executive Committee provides the Supervisory Board and
its committees with all the information necessary for the
proper performance of their supervisory duties and as
requested by the Supervisory Board through the Chairman
of the Executive Committee.
In the execution of its duties, the Executive Committee
focuses on client centricity, the activities and needs of the
business lines, transformation, innovation, digitalisation
and sustainable growth of operating income and promotes
ABN AMRO Bank’s and its subsidiaries’ values through
leading by example.
Composition and diversity
The Executive Board consists of the Chief Executive
Officer (CEO), the Chief Financial Officer (CFO), the Chief
Risk Officer (CRO) and the Chief Innovation & Technology
Officer (CI&TO). The Executive Committee is chaired by
the CEO and consists of the four statutory Executive
Board members and five non-statutory senior executives,
including four business line roles (Retail Banking,
Commercial Banking, Corporate & Institutional Banking,
and Private Banking) and one role with bank-wide
responsibilities (HR, Transformation & Communications).
The management structure is thus designed to create an
enhanced focus on the bank’s business activities at a
senior executive level.
The Executive Committee’s composition is based on
ABN AMRO’s guiding principle that diversity of thought,
expertise, background, competences and interpersonal
styles, thus including but not limited to gender diversity,
is a prerequisite for effective management and, by
extension, for long-term value creation. In line with its
diversity policy, ABN AMRO is striving to meet the gender
target of 30% for the Executive Committee and Executive
Board. Gender diversity within the Executive Committee
is currently 22%, and 25% within the Executive Board.
When vacancies arise, ABN AMRO Group will give due
consideration to any applicable gender requirements
in its search to find suitable new members meeting the
fit and proper requirements stipulated in the Dutch
Financial Markets Supervision Act.
The Rules of Procedure of the Executive Board and the
Executive Committee are available on abnamro.com.

Appointment, suspension and dismissal
Members of the Executive Board are appointed and
reappointed by the Supervisory Board for a maximum
term of three years, provided that the term of office
continues up to and including the first General Meeting
to be held after the expiry of this term. The diversity
objectives laid down in ABN AMRO’s internal policies
are considered in the preparation of the appointment
and reappointment of the members of the Executive
Board. The Supervisory Board notifies the General
Meeting of the intended appointment or reappointment of
a member of the Executive Board. Only candidates who
meet the fit and proper test under the Dutch Financial
Markets Supervision Act are eligible for appointment. The
Supervisory Board may appoint one of the members of
the Executive Board as Chairman (to be awarded the title
of Chief Executive Officer). Pursuant to the relationship
agreement with NLFI, the Supervisory Board gives NLFI
the opportunity to advise on the decision to appoint or
reappoint a member of the Executive Board and on the
decision to appoint the chairman of the Executive Board,
as long as NLFI directly or indirectly holds at least 10% of
the issued share capital of the Company. The Supervisory
Board may at all times suspend a member of the
Executive Board. Further information on the suspension
and dismissal procedure of the Executive Board is
provided in ABN AMRO Group’s Articles of Association
and the Executive Board Rules of Procedure as published
on the ABN AMRO website.
Members of the Executive Committee (other than
members of the Executive Board) are appointed,
suspended and/or dismissed by the Executive Board
subject to the approval of the Supervisory Board and
advice of the Remuneration, Selection & Nomination
Committee. The Executive Board takes into account
ABN AMRO’s diversity objectives in respect of the
composition of the Executive Committee. Only candidates
who meet the fit and proper test under the Dutch
Financial Markets Supervision Act are eligible for
appointment. The CEO is the Chairman of the Executive
Committee. The Supervisory Board, upon the proposal of
the Executive Board and the advice of the Remuneration,
Selection & Nomination Committee, appoints one
member of the Executive Board as Vice-Chairman of the
Executive Committee. Members of the Executive
Committee are appointed and reappointed for a maximum
term of four years.
Committees
The Executive Board has established a number of
committees that are responsible for the preparation of
decision-making on certain subjects, for taking certain
delegated decisions and for advising the Executive Board
on certain matters. This includes the following three
risk-related committees: the Group Risk Committee,
the Group Assets & Liabilities Committee and the Group
Central Credit Committee. More information on the
delegated authority of these committees is provided
in the Risk, funding & capital section.
In addition, the Executive Board has installed the Group
Disclosure Committee and the Group Regulatory
Committee.
The Group Disclosure Committee is responsible for,
among other things, advising and supporting the
Executive Board in relation to (i) supervision on the
accuracy and timeliness of public disclosures by the
Group, and (ii) integrity with regard to the financial
statements and other public disclosures.
The Group Regulatory Committee is responsible for,

In February 2018 it was announced that Ms Olga Zoutendijk
had decided not to stand for a second term of office as
a member of the Supervisory Board and to transfer her
duties as Chairman of the Supervisory Board with
immediate effect. A search process for a new Chairman
was consequently initiated. The Vice-Chairman,
Mr Steven ten Have, temporarily assumed the duties
of Chairman until the new Chairman, Mr Tom de Swaan,
was appointed at the Extraordinary General Meeting on
12 July 2018. Mr ten Have was reappointed for a maximum
of two years at the Annual General Meeting on
29 May 2018. As a result, he has been appointed for a
total term in excess of eight years. The Supervisory Board
proposed Mr ten Have’s reappointment in accordance
with the Employee Council’s recommendation and in
acknowledgement of the valuable role he has fulfilled
as a member and Vice-Chairman of the Supervisory Board,
and the individual and collective profile included
in the meeting documents for the General Meeting.
The Supervisory Board also recognised the need to ensure
continuity in the Supervisory Board.
Mr Steven ten Have and Ms Frederieke Leeflang have
decided to resign from ABN AMRO’s Supervisory Board
in 2019 in order to allow for the appointment of
Ms Anna Storåkers and Mr Michiel Lap, two proposed
new members with extensive experience in the financial
sector. Ms Storåkers and Mr Lap will be nominated for
appointment to the Supervisory Board for a period of four
years at the Annual General Meeting on 24 April 2019.
Their appointments will be subject to regulatory approval.
Mr ten Have was appointed pursuant to the enhanced
recommendation right of the Employee Council. As agreed
with the Employee Council, Mr Arjen Dorland will be
attributed the latter capacity with effect from the Annual
General Meeting on 24 April 2019.
Role and responsibilities of the Supervisory Board
The Supervisory Board supervises, advises, challenges
and supports the Executive Board and the Executive
Committee in the exercise of their powers and duties.
Together with the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board
is responsible for ABN AMRO’s long-term value creation,
requiring members to execute their duties in a sustainable
manner with due observance of the long-term viability of
the strategy being pursued. In discharging its task, the
Supervisory Board takes into account the dynamics and
the relationship between the Executive Board and the
Executive Committee and its members. The Supervisory
Board’s early and close involvement with the Executive
Board is required in formulating the bank-wide strategy
and targets, in line with the pursued culture aimed at
long-term value creation.
In performing their duties, the members of the
Supervisory Board are guided by the interests of
ABN AMRO and its businesses, taking the legitimate
interests of all of ABN AMRO’s stakeholders (such as its
clients, savers and deposit holders, shareholders, holders
of depositary receipts, employees and the society in
which ABN AMRO operates) into due consideration.
Specific powers are vested in the Supervisory Board,
including the approval of certain decisions taken by the
Executive Board.
Composition and diversity
The Supervisory Board’s composition is based on the
Board’s guiding principle that diversity of thought,
expertise, background, competences and interpersonal
styles, thus including but not limited to gender diversity,
is a prerequisite for effective supervision and, by
extension, for long-term value creation. In line with its
diversity policy, ABN AMRO is striving to meet the gender
target of 30% for the Supervisory Board. Gender diversity
within the Supervisory Board of ABN AMRO is currently
29%. When vacancies arise, ABN AMRO Group will give
due consideration to any applicable gender requirements
in its search to find suitable new members meeting the fit
and proper requirements stipulated in the Dutch Financial
Markets Supervision Act. Collectively the members have
expertise in retail and private banking, commercial
banking, corporate & institutional banking, investment
banking, risk management, P&L line management,
strategy formulation and execution, cultural and other
change management, IT, digitalisation, innovation,
economics, remuneration and human resources
management, sustainability and corporate social
responsibility, legal and compliance matters and the
development of products and services, and experience
in the key markets in which the bank is active. The
Supervisory Board has one financial expert (CPA/RA), in
accordance with the formal definition and requirements,
and two highly experienced bankers with a combined total
of 60 years of broad and deep banking experience across
all key areas of domestic and international banking.

Appointment, suspension and dismissal
Members of the Supervisory Board are appointed by the
General Meeting, following nomination by the Supervisory
Board itself. Only candidates who have passed the fit and
proper test under the Dutch Financial Markets Supervision
Act are eligible for appointment. The General Meeting and
the Employee Council may recommend candidates to
the Supervisory Board to be nominated as members of
the Supervisory Board.
In accordance with the best practice provisions of the
Dutch Corporate Governance Code, Supervisory Board
members are appointed for a period ending at the close
of the first General Meeting that is held after four (4) years
have passed since their last appointment, unless a shorter
period was set at the time of the appointment. The
Supervisory Board is required to nominate a candidate
recommended by the Employee Council in respect of
one-third of the members of the Supervisory Board
(the so-called ‘enhanced recommendation right’).
The Supervisory Board must accept the recommendation
of the Employee Council, unless it believes that the
candidate recommended is unsuitable to fulfil the duties
of a member of the Supervisory Board, or that the
Supervisory Board would not be properly composed if the
appointment were made as recommended. In 2018
Mr Steven ten Have and Ms Annemieke Roobeek were
the members of the Supervisory Board appointed
following the enhanced recommendation right.
The Supervisory Board may suspend any of its members
at any time. The General Meeting can dismiss the
Supervisory Board in its entirety due to lack of confidence
in the Board, by an absolute majority of the votes cast,
representing a quorum of at least one-third of the issued
share capital. If this quorum is not met, there is
no possibility of holding a second General Meeting in
which no quorum applies. Further information on the
suspension and dismissal procedure is provided in
ABN AMRO Group’s Articles of Association and the
Supervisory Board Rules of Procedure as published on
the ABN AMRO website.
Committees
The Supervisory Board has established three committees
to prepare its decision-making and to advise the
Supervisory Board on specific matters. These committees
are composed exclusively of Supervisory Board members.
These committees are the:

Meetings of the Supervisory Board
During 2018, the Supervisory Board held five formal
meetings according to the pre-set schedule, twenty-three
additional meetings and four informal team meetings.
The additional meetings focused on specific subjects,
such as composition and competency profile of the
Supervisory Board, strategy, capital distributions/buybacks, on-site inspections, succession planning and the
budget plan for 2019-2022. Supervisory Board meetings
take place following the meetings of the Remuneration,
Selection & Nomination Committee, the Risk & Capital
Committee and the Audit Committee. The Supervisory
Board receives from each of these committees a report of
its deliberations and findings after each meeting and takes
into account the outcome and recommendations of these
committees. The Company Secretary attends all meetings
and is the secretary of the Supervisory Board and its
committees. The Executive Board attends the formal
meetings of the Supervisory Board and prepares detailed
supporting documents. The regular meetings last for an
average of four hours. At each Supervisory Board meeting,
on a rotational basis, an Executive Committee member is
invited to give a presentation on the opportunities and
risks in their specific line of business. Other bank staff
and the external auditor were frequently invited to give
presentations on specific topics such as performance
highlights, the capital & funding plan, dividends, strategy,
an investor relations update, the risk appetite, quarterly
risk reports and quarterly audit reports. The implementation
of the bank’s strategy was extensively discussed in
several meetings with the Executive Board and Executive
Committee. These discussions included a critical review
of the business lines, an assessment of the strategic
challenges and risks, external (global) developments
and trends, and how to execute the strategy in order
to create long-term value.

on 12 March 2019 can be found in the Composition and
diversity paragraph in the Supervisory Board section

Focus areas and activities of the Supervisory Board
During the year, the bank refreshed its strategic priorities.
These are to support our clients’ transition to sustainability,
to reinvent the customer experience, and to build a
future-proof bank. In July, the Supervisory Board and
the Executive Committee spent two days extensively
discussing the scope, ambition and approach for the
strategic pillars. This is a good example of the Supervisory
Board’s collaboration with the Executive Committee, and
where the focus is on long-term subjects that matter and
on setting the strategic framework for executive actions.
The refreshed Long-Term Vision & Strategy was launched
in October 2018. The refreshed budget plan 2019-2022,
which is an important aspect of the refreshed strategy,
was discussed during the budget process later in the year.
Other key topics that the Supervisory Board discussed
with management during the year included improving the
bank’s cost-to-income ratio, simplifying internal processes
and controls, regulatory topics, optimising the bank’s
return on equity, updating the capital plan based on Basel
IV, improving the overall data quality (especially given the
increasing frequency of detailed data requests by the
regulators) and IT innovation, as well as cybersecurity and
the development of talent within the bank, including
leadership development and succession planning at
a management body level.
The Supervisory Board’s key areas of focus also included the
bank’s compliance with legislation, codes and regulations,
specifically the preparations for implementing the EBA
Guidelines on Internal Governance and the EBA Guidelines
on Suitability. The Supervisory Board was also regularly
updated on ABN AMRO’s key financial and non-financial
risks and the design of the internal risk management and
control systems. During these updates the Executive Board’s
assessment of the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk
management and control systems was monitored and
Report of the Supervisory Board

Leadership & governance / Report of the Supervisory Board 133
discussed. The bank’s risk appetite and ICAAP/ILAAP were
also discussed and approved. The Supervisory Board discussed
material legal, credit, tax and compliance files in depth.
Banks have a responsibility to help protect the financial
services sector. The Supervisory Board sees that ABN
AMRO takes this responsibility very seriously. It invests
significant resources in combatting financial crime and
works closely with regulators, governments, other banks
and law enforcement agencies. Accordingly, the topic of
financial crime was discussed during various Supervisory
Board meetings, as well as Risk & Capital and Audit
Committee meetings.
ABN AMRO has decided, based on self-identified shortcomings and input from the Dutch Central Bank, to accelerate
its existing Customer Due Diligence (CDD) programme in
order to become compliant with anti-money laundering
and terrorist financing legislation. The Supervisory Board
understands that ABN AMRO already carried out a review
of our Corporate & Institutional Banking business and that a
review of its Private Banking clients is now nearly complete.
ABN AMRO has developed remediation programmes to
speed up remediation actions in relation to International
Card Services (ICS) and Commercial Banking and has shared
these with the Dutch Central Bank and committed to their
execution. For the incremental external costs involved, the
Supervisory Board agreed with a provision taken in 2018
of EUR 85 million – for ICS and Commercial Banking. The
amount is based on, among other items, the total number
of files, the time needed to review each file and the
percentage that will be reviewed using external resources.
Over the past year, a number of European banks have
been the object of money laundering investigations. The
Supervisory Board recognises that, with financial crime,
ABN AMRO has to be vigilant and needs to be constantly
looking for ways to strengthen its systems and raise
awareness of potential risks within the bank. Therefore,
the Supervisory Board encourages ABN AMRO to continue
investing in combatting financial crime of any form.
Members of the Supervisory Board actively engaged its key
stakeholders in 2018, visiting various parts of the
organisation in the Netherlands and internationally to
obtain client and staff feedback regarding the bank’s duty
of care, integrity, client focus, culture and competitive
differentiation. The two members appointed pursuant to
the enhanced recommendation right of the Employee
Council, Mr ten Have and Ms Roobeek, met regularly with
the Employee Council throughout the year to maintain an
active dialogue and to obtain the Employee Council’s
thoughts and input on various matters, including the top
management structure, appointments, diversity, work
satisfaction and the negotiations for a new Collective Labour
Agreement, which was concluded at the beginning of 2018.
The Chairman and other members of the Supervisory Board
also met with the Employee Council on several formal and
informal occasions during the year. This included the annual
half-day joint meeting of the Supervisory Board, the
Executive Committee and the Employee Council (‘drie
raden overleg’), held on 27 September 2018. This year, the
joint session focused on the revised strategy, and more
specifically on the third pillar of building a future-proof bank
by further developing a solid and stable organisation that is
open and transparent and able to respond optimally to the
market. The Supervisory Board appreciates the constructive
relationship it has with the Employee Council, and highly
values the input, engagement, suggestions and considerations
provided by the Employee Council in the interests of the
bank. Active engagement was also maintained throughout
the year with the Dutch Central Bank (DNB), the European
Central Bank (ECB), AFM, STAK AAG and NLFI. The
Supervisory Board’s aim throughout was to ensure that the
bank is well positioned to create long-term value for its
shareholders and for society, while focusing firmly on clients’
interests and balancing the interests of all stakeholders.
The Supervisory Board approved amendments to the
Executive Board Rules of Procedure (including the
Executive Committee Rules of Procedure) and the
Supervisory Board Rules of Procedure on 30 June 2018.
These amendments represented the formal incorporation
of the EBA Guidelines on Suitability and Internal
Governance into the Rules of Procedure.
A description of the duties, responsibilities and current
composition of the Supervisory Board, including its
committees and other positions held by members of the
Supervisory Board, is provided in the Supervisory Board
section of this chapter. More information on remuneration
is provided under Remuneration in this chapter. These
subjects are considered to be incorporated, by reference,
in this Report of the Supervisory Board.
Supervisory Board Committees
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is tasked with the direct supervision
of all matters relating to financial reporting and controlling.
In doing so, it is responsible for supervising and advising
the complete Supervisory Board on topics such as
(i) the assessment of the principles of valuation and
determination of results for the financial statements,
(ii) internal control and financial reporting functions, (iii)
internal and external audit, (iv) risk assessment of issues
that could impact the financial reporting, (v) regulatory
compliance in relation to financial reporting, (vi) mediation
between internal or external auditors and/or management
if required, and (vii) reporting to the Supervisory Board.
Throughout 2018, the Audit Committee (the ‘Committee’)
consisted of Mr Tjalling Tiemstra (Chairman), Mr Arjen
Dorland and Mr Jurgen Stegmann. Ms Olga Zoutendijk was
also a member of the Committee until her resignation from
the Supervisory Board on 1 July 2018. Mr Tom de Swaan
replaced Ms Zoutendijk as a member of the Committee
on 12 July 2018. The Committee held six regular plenary
meetings in 2018.

In addition, Mr Steven ten Have, in his role as acting
Chairman of the Supervisory Board, attended one plenary
meeting of the Committee in March 2018. All regular
plenary meetings of the Committee were also attended
by the CEO, the CFO and the CRO. The Director of Group
Audit, the Director of Financial Accounting, the external
auditor and the Company Secretary also attended the full
plenary meetings. At one meeting, however, a representative
of the Director of Group Audit was present, while a
representative of the Director of Financial Accounting was
present at another meeting, and a representative of the
Company Secretary was present at a further meeting.
Lastly, it was decided that, from November 2018 onwards,
the Director of Corporate Controlling would attend plenary
Committee meetings on a standard basis.
Additionally, the Committee held a conference call in
January 2018 to discuss the bank’s readiness for IFRS 9 and
to pre-discuss the final 2017 dividend proposal. The CFO,
the CRO, the external auditor, the Director of Financial
Accounting, the Company Secretary and a representative of
the Director of Group Audit also joined this conference call.
In addition to the plenary meetings, the Chairman and
other members of the Committee regularly held separate
sessions throughout 2018 with officers such as the
Director of Group Audit, the CFO, the CRO, the Director of
Financial Accounting and the Director of Corporate
Controlling. The Chairman of the Committee met the
external auditor bilaterally several times in 2018, focusing
on the progress of the external audit and other subjects
relevant to the responsibilities of the Committee. The
Chairman also met with the European Central Bank and
the Dutch Central Bank once in 2018. In addition,
Committee members met various department managers
to ensure the members remained well informed about the
subjects under their supervision. Directly after the
meeting in March 2018, when the annual accounts were
discussed, the Committee met the external auditor
bilaterally to seek confirmation that all relevant matters
from the audit had come to the Committee’s attention.
The topics discussed by the Committee in the plenary
meetings included the quarterly reports, the interim and
annual accounts, the quarterly press releases, the interim
and final dividend proposals, the 2017 Integrated Annual
Review and 2017 Annual Report of ABN AMRO, and key
audit matters reported by internal and external audit, such
as those described in the Independent Auditor’s Report
on page 258 and further of this Annual Report. In relation
to the latter, the Audit Committee discussed all control
observations and key audit matters identified by the
internal and external auditors, including progress on
improvements. The Committee also discussed financial
reporting, the overall internal control environment, the
governance and internal controls pertaining to financial
reporting, adherence to legislation and regulations
governing financial and regulatory reporting with a focus
on IFRS 9, regular reports on any signals from clients or
employees suggesting possible internal control issues,
and updates on tax and tax-related issues.
The Committee extensively discussed the performance
and audit ratings of the bank’s first- and second-line
departments on a quarterly basis. During each meeting
the Committee devoted attention to the procedures for
financial reporting, including the procedure for establishing
loan impairments, the timelines in which impairments are
established, and the robustness and development of the
financial results and ratios, including the level of loan
impairments. The Committee also took note of financial
reports issued to supervisory authorities, such as the
COREP and FINREP reports.
In addition, the Committee considered the role,
performance and reports from Group Audit, reports from
the external auditor, management letters and the auditor’s
independence and fees. The Committee was also
informed of, and discussed, all relevant letters from the
European Central Bank and the Dutch Central Bank. The
Committee closely monitored the financial and regulatory
reporting improvement programmes in 2018 and was
regularly updated on the progress of these programmes by
the Executive Board, Group Audit and the external auditor.
As well as the regular topics mentioned above, in February
2018 the Committee received the report of the external
auditor regarding the 2017 Consolidated Annual Financial
Statements. The Committee also exchanged views on a
letter from the VEB, focusing on the explanation provided
by the external auditor during the Annual General Meeting.
In March 2018, the Committee reviewed and discussed
the 2017 Integrated Annual Review, the 2017 Annual 
ABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018
Introduction Strategy and performance Risk, funding & capital Leadership Governance Annual Financial Statements Other
Leadership & governance / Report of the Supervisory Board 135
Reports of ABN AMRO Group and ABN AMRO Bank and
the audits by the external auditor of these reports, the
Management Control Statement and the overview of
whistleblowing cases for the year 2017.
In May, in addition to the regular agenda items, the
Committee discussed the 2018 Audit Plan of the external
auditor and was updated by the Director of Group Tax on
ABN AMRO’s tax control framework and tax policy.
In August 2018, apart from the standard agenda items,
the Committee discussed and subsequently advised the
Supervisory Board to approve the auditor independence
policy. For the first time, the Committee also reviewed
the proposal to extend the appointment of EY as
ABN AMRO’s external auditor.
In November 2018, in addition to the standard agenda
items, the Committee advised the Supervisory Board to
approve the Group Audit Plan 2019 and the annual review
of the Group Audit Charter. The Committee was also
informed of the most important tax developments
for ABN AMRO. Lastly, the Committee advised the
Supervisory Board positively on both the appointment
of external auditors as part of the planned legal merger
between ABN AMRO Group and ABN AMRO Bank and
on the reappointment of EY as the bank’s external auditor
for 2019, 2020 and 2021.
Risk & Capital Committee
The Risk & Capital Committee is responsible for supervising
(and advising the complete Supervisory Board on) topics such
as (i) risk management and risk control, (ii) the strategies
for capital and liquidity management, (iii) the bank’s risk
appetite and risk strategy and reviewing the business
activities in relation to these matters, (iv) compliance with
applicable laws and regulations (including codes of conduct
and internal procedures), (v) risk and compliance awareness
within the bank, (vi) sound remuneration policies and
practices in light of risk, capital, liquidity and expected
earnings, (vii) proposing corrective and/or disciplinary
measures against members of the Executive Board in the
event of a breach of applicable laws and regulations, and
(viii) periodic review of the Group’s actual risk profile.
The Risk & Capital Committee (the ‘Committee’) consisted
of Mr Jurgen Stegmann (Chairman), Mr Arjen Dorland,
Ms Frederieke Leeflang, Ms Annemieke Roobeek,
Mr Tom de Swaan (from July 2018), Mr Tjalling Tiemstra
and Ms Olga Zoutendijk (until July 2018). The Committee
held nine plenary meetings in 2018, four of which were
regular meetings and five of which were additional
meetings. These additional meetings discussed deep
dives on mortgages, non-presence country activities,
Global Markets, the ICAAP and ILAAP submission for
2018, and progress on specific Compliance change
projects. All matters discussed at a plenary meeting of the
Committee and which were relevant for the Supervisory
Board were orally reported at the next full Supervisory
Board meeting. The full Supervisory Board also received
minutes of the Committee meetings.
The attendance rate of the members of the Committee
was as follows:
2018 Regular meetings (4) Additional meetings (5) Total meetings (9) Attendance (%)
T. de Swaan1 1 1 2 50%
O.L. Zoutendijk2 1 2 3 60%

J.S.T. Tiemstra 3 4 7 78%
1 Appointment date 12 July 2018 after which 4 meetings were held. 2 Resignation date 1 July 2018 before which 5 meetings were held.
Recurring items on the Committee’s agenda in 2018 were
the Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Report, the Capital
& Funding Plan Update, Compliance and Legal Updates,
regulatory correspondence with the ECB and DNB, and
the Risk Policy Approval Report Update, which provides a
quarterly overview of changes in relevant risk policies.
Additionally, the CRO and CFO provided quarterly updates at
the regular Committee meetings on relevant developments in
their respective areas of control. As the prevailing economic
cycle warranted increased attention for credit risk, the
Committee also received a Quarterly Credit Risk Report from
August 2018 onwards on quarterly credit risk parameter
developments, including developments in impairments,
modelling, the cost of risk and the coverage ratio.
The ERM Report provides a concise overview of ABN AMRO’s
position on all risk types identified in the risk taxonomy, as
well as aiming to identify cross-risk type issues and effects
and to provide a single integrated view on the bank’s risk
profile, benchmarked against the bank’s risk appetite
(which is established periodically by the Executive Board
and approved by the Supervisory Board after advice from
the Committee). Over the year, more attention was paid
to geopolitical risks. Also change risk is now considered
as a separate risk area. Other important subjects included
in the ERM Report are the bank’s largest single exposures
and specific impairments. Based on the ERM Report, the
Committee also discussed matters related to risk governance,
operational risks, market risks, tax risks and credit
concentration risks. The ERM Report and all other regular

and one-off reports were used by the Committee to
maintain oversight, challenge and advise the Executive
Board on the operation and efficiency of the bank’s
operations versus its risk appetite, including the
functioning of its internal Risk Management function.
Each quarter the Committee assessed the updated Capital
& Funding Plans and was informed about the bank’s current
capital and funding positions. The Committee discussed
the bank’s management of its capital and liquidity ratios,
including the issuance plans for capital and funding and
options for RWA steering. Particular attention was paid to
the impact of Basel IV on the bank’s capital position, as
well as a potential additional sustainable profit distribution,
based on the bank’s Basel III capital target range 2019 of
17.5-18.5% and subject to the 2019 SREP requirement. In
all instances, the Committee advised the Supervisory
Board to approve the Capital & Funding Plan as proposed.
Based on the quarterly Compliance and Legal Reports, the
Committee discussed individual Legal, Tax and Compliance
files, the performance of the Compliance function,
Compliance policies and procedures, the relationship with
the supervisory authorities and the impact of national and
international laws and regulations. Examples of the files
that were discussed included the settlement for SME
derivatives-related issues, complaints relating to Euriborbased mortgages, the International Card Services redress
scheme and the duty of care in relation to bank account
transaction monitoring. Lastly, the Committee discussed
the annual plans of the Compliance and Legal departments.
The Committee was informed of the correspondence with
the Dutch Central Bank, the European Central Bank and
other relevant supervisory authorities in quarterly oversight
reports prepared by Group Audit and Compliance. Particular
attention in this context was paid to on-site inspections by
the ECB and to the EBA stress test results and process.
The Committee also paid specific attention, at three
additional meetings, to certain Compliance change projects
in the areas of MiFID II, customer due diligence and the
duty of care. Worries regarding compliance with AML
requirements, and the increasing importance and level of
attention for this topic were a permanent agenda item.
Given the prominence of these subjects, the Committee
expects to devote continued interest to these areas in
2019. Lastly, other topics discussed by the Committee
included data quality in general, cybersecurity, Brexit,
commercial real estate and consumer credit.
More information on the risk, capital, liquidity and fundingrelated topics discussed by the Committee is provided in
the Risk, funding & capital section.
Remuneration, Selection & Nomination Committee
The Remuneration, Selection & Nomination Committee
(the ‘Committee’) is responsible for supervising (and
advising the complete Supervisory Board on) topics such
as (i) remuneration policies and their execution for
members of the Executive Board, the Supervisory Board
and selected members of senior management, (ii) the
selection, appointment and reappointment of Supervisory
Board and Executive Board members, (iii) succession
plans of the Supervisory Board and the Executive Board,
(iv) the knowledge, skills, experience, performance, size,
composition and profile of both boards, (v) the
performance of the members of these boards, (vi)
reporting on the execution of the remuneration policies in
a remuneration report, and (vii) total human capital,
including talent and leadership development.
The Remuneration, Selection & Nomination Committee
consists of Mr Arjen Dorland (Chairman), Mr Steven ten
Have, Ms Frederieke Leeflang, Ms Annemieke Roobeek
and Mr Tom de Swaan. As Mr ten Have had temporarily
assumed the duties of the Chairman of the Supervisory
Board, Mr Arjen Dorland temporarily assumed the duties
of Chairman of the Committee from 12 February 2018.
Mr ten Have has since switched his role as Chairman for
that of member of the Committee. After the new Chairman
of the Supervisory Board was appointed, Mr Arjen Dorland
was formally appointed Chairman of the Committee.
In 2018, the Committee held six regular meetings and
nine additional meetings. Four decisions were made
without a meeting being held, in compliance with proper
procedure. All Committee members made sure to review
all relevant documents and to provide their input to the
Committee Chairman in advance of any meeting that they
were unable to attend. The CEO, the member of the
Executive Committee responsible for Transformation & HR
and the Company Secretary also attended the meetings.
In accordance with stricter legislation, the Supervisory
Board continued in 2018 to ratify all decisions made by the
Committee, either at a meeting or in writing without
a meeting being held. 
The attendance rate of the members of the Committee
was as follows:
2018 Formal meetings (6) Additional meetings (9) Total meetings (15) Attendance (%)

Leadership & governance / Report of the Supervisory Board 137
In February and March, the proposals for the end-of-year
process (decisions on organisation-wide Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs), performance ratings of the Executive
Board, determination of Identified Staff and related
variable compensation and target-setting for 2018) were
considered and discussed and presented to the
Supervisory Board with a positive advice.
A full evaluation of the new management structure
was conducted by external experts in early 2018
(see “Performance Evaluation” below).
The discussion on a necessary redesign of the KPI
framework that started in 2016 was completed in 2018.
The Committee regularly challenged the existing
framework, recommending its replacement by a simpler
framework with more emphasis on leadership. Financial
KPIs have since been added to align with the bank’s new
strategic direction. The Committee also recommended
sharpening the KPI sustainability for the coming years.
In addition, a new performance management system was
introduced for staff covered by the Collective Labour
Agreement. This is part of the agile way of working and
entails a continual dialogue on targets.
In addition, the Committee recommended that more
management attention should be paid to crucial matters
such as talent and leadership development, talent retention,
succession planning, diversity in the broadest sense, the
design and establishment of a leadership development
function and programme, purpose and culture change.
Other subjects that were discussed extensively
throughout the year included the process for selecting
and nominating the new Chairman and two prospective
Supervisory Board members (all these searches were
conducted by an independent, external search firm,
based on clearly defined role descriptions, and included
interviews with multiple candidates for each role),
succession planning, the European Banking Authority
suitability guidelines and the results of the 2018
Employee Engagement Survey.
Performance evaluation
When the Executive Committee was set up in March
2017, it was decided that the new management structure
should be evaluated after a year. The Supervisory Board and
the Executive Board commissioned two external experts
to carry out this evaluation. This evaluation, carried out in
2018, addressed themes such as the Executive Board and
Executive Committee structures, the Supervisory Board’s
role and involvement, the bank’s leadership, purpose and
strategic story, as well as the implementation of the
culture change. At the same time, the ECB was working
with DNB to evaluate the same issues, particularly internal
governance and risk management, as part of its on-site
inspections 2018. From both evaluations board room
dynamics (the way of working together, leadership style
and open relationships) as well as technical aspects (the
importance of clearly allocated tasks and responsibilities)
came up as focus areas. These focus areas have been
extensively discussed and are currently being addressed.
The assessments of the Supervisory Board, Executive
Board and Executive Committee for the 2018 performance
year will be carried out in 2019.
Introductory Programme and Lifelong Learning
Programme
Introductory Programme
Following their appointment, all new members of the
Supervisory Board complete an extensive introductory
programme designed to ensure they have the relevant
knowledge needed to fulfil their role, including thorough
knowledge of ABN AMRO Group and its business
activities, financial reporting by the Group and general
financial, social and legal affairs. As the knowledge,
background and experience of newly appointed members
of the Supervisory Board differ, the curriculum of the
introductory programme is tailor-made.
Lifelong Learning Programme
A lifelong learning programme is in place for members
of the Executive Board and Executive Committee.
This is designed to keep their expertise up to date and to
broaden and deepen their knowledge, where necessary.
The objective is for members of the Executive Board and
Executive Committee to participate in the same training
sessions so as to foster knowledge-sharing. The curriculum
is developed and updated continually to ensure a balanced
programme covering all relevant aspects of the bank’s
performance and taking into account current developments
in the global financial industry. Topics covered in 2018, in
joint sessions with management, included risk governance,
culture and conduct, interest rate risk management, data
and modelling, sustainability, agile ways of doing business
and innovation. The members of the Supervisory Board
focused in 2018 on technical knowledge relating to
non-financial risks, MIFID II, GDPR and cybersecurity.

Leadership & governance / General Meeting and shareholder structure
General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting is held each year no
later than 30 June. The agenda for the Annual General
Meeting must contain certain subjects as specified in
ABN AMRO Group’s Articles of Association and under
Dutch law, for example the adoption of the Annual
Financial Statements. Shareholders or holders of
depositary receipts who alone or together represent at
least 3% of the issued share capital of ABN AMRO Group
are entitled to have items added to the agenda of the
General Meeting, provided they submit a request for this
(including reasons) to ABN AMRO Group at least 60 days
prior to the General Meeting.
  
The Supervisory Board and the Executive Board can both
convene a General Meeting. Shareholders or holders
of depositary receipts issued with the cooperation of
ABN AMRO Group may also convene a General Meeting,
if they represent at least 10% of the issued share capital.
NLFI may also request the Executive Board or Supervisory
Board to convene a General Meeting, as stated in the
Relationship Agreement.
Extraordinary General Meetings may be convened
if deemed necessary to resolve upon important
decisions, such as major acquisitions and divestments or
appointments of Supervisory Board members, that cannot
be deferred until the next Annual General Meeting.
ABN AMRO Group held three General Meetings in 2018:
the Annual General Meeting on 29 May and Extraordinary
General Meetings on 28 February and 12 July.
The agenda of the Annual General Meeting of
ABN AMRO Group on 29 May 2018 included:
Å the adoption of the 2017 Annual Financial Statements;
Å the approval of the proposed dividend for the year 2017;
Å the discharge of each member of the Executive and
Supervisory Boards in office during the financial
year 2017;
Å the authorisation for the Executive Board to (a) issue
shares and grant rights to subscribe to rights for shares
for a period of 18 months up to a maximum of 10% of
the issued share capital of ABN AMRO Group, (b) limit
or exclude pre-emptive rights, and (c) acquire shares or
depositary receipts representing shares in
ABN AMRO Group’s own capital for a period of
18 months, subject to the approval of the Supervisory
Board and provided that the total number of shares or
Depositary Receipts held by ABN AMRO is limited to
10% of the issued share capital of ABN AMRO Group;
Å the cancellation of shares or depositary receipts
representing shares in ABN AMRO Group’s own capital
held by ABN AMRO Group and the related reduction
of the authorised capital;
Å the reappointment of Mr Steven ten Have as a member
of the Supervisory Board.

ABN AMRO Bank is a wholly-owned subsidiary of
ABN AMRO Group. At 31 December 2018, all shares
in the capital of ABN AMRO Group were held by two
foundations: NLFI and STAK AAG. On that date, NLFI held
56.3% in ABN AMRO Group, of which 49.9% is directly
held via ordinary shares and 6.4% is indirectly held via
depositary receipts for shares in ABN AMRO Group.
On that date, STAK AAG held 50.1% of the shares in the
issued capital of ABN AMRO Group. Only STAK AAG’s
depositary receipts have been issued with the
cooperation of ABN AMRO Group and are traded
on Euronext Amsterdam.
NLFI
The Dutch State holds an interest in ABN AMRO Group
through NLFI. NLFI was set up with the objective to
avoid potential conflicting responsibilities that the Dutch
Minister of Finance might otherwise face and to avoid
undesired political influence being exerted. NLFI issued
exchangeable depositary receipts for shares in the
capital of ABN AMRO Group to the Dutch State. NLFI is
responsible for managing these shares and exercising
all rights associated with these shares under Dutch
law, including voting rights. NLFI acts as a standalone
shareholder independently from the Dutch State, including
the Dutch Ministry of Finance. However, important
decisions taken by NLFI require the prior approval of the
Dutch Minister of Finance, who can also give binding
voting instructions to NLFI with respect to such decisions.
NLFI is not permitted to dispose of or encumber the
ordinary shares in the capital of ABN AMRO Group,
except pursuant to an authorisation from and on behalf of
the Dutch Minister of Finance.
NLFI entered into a Relationship Agreement with
ABN AMRO Group governing their relationship after
the IPO. The full text of the Relationship Agreement is
available on abnamro.com. The Relationship Agreement
will terminate if and when NLFI (directly or indirectly)
holds less than 10% of ABN AMRO Group’s issued share
capital. A limited number of clauses will not terminate
under any circumstances. The Relationship Agreement
includes, among other things, the following provisions,
subject to certain conditions stated in the agreement:
Å the right of NLFI to be consulted by (a) the Supervisory
Board on the appointment or reappointment of (i)
members of the Managing Board and (ii) the Chairman
of the Managing Board or the Supervisory Board,
and (b) the Managing Board on a proposal for the
appointment of the external auditor. The references to
‘Managing Board’ are currently to be understood to
refer to the Executive Board;
Å NLFI’s right of prior approval of any issuance
of (or granting of rights to acquire) shares in
ABN AMRO Group or ABN AMRO Bank for as long
as NLFI holds at least 33 1/3% of the shares in
ABN AMRO Group;
Å for as long as NLFI holds more than 50% of the shares
in ABN AMRO Group: any investments or divestments
by ABN AMRO Group or any of its subsidiaries
with a value of more than 5% of the equity of
ABN AMRO Group, and
Å for as long as NLFI holds 50% or less but 33 1/3%
or more of the shares in ABN AMRO Group: any
investment or divestments by ABN AMRO Group or
any of its subsidiaries with a value of more than 10%
of the equity of ABN AMRO Group;
Å the obligation of NLFI to effect sell-downs of
ABN AMRO Group shares through STAK AAG;
Å certain orderly market arrangements; and
Å certain information rights for NLFI as long as it holds
at least 33 1/3% of the shares in ABN AMRO Group.
STAK AAG
STAK AAG is independent from ABN AMRO and the
holder of shares in ABN AMRO Group’s issued share
capital. STAK AAG has acquired such shares for the
purpose of administration (ten titel van beheer) in
exchange for depositary receipts. The manner in which
this structure can serve as a defence measure and
STAK AAG’s role in this is further described in this
section under Anti-takeover measures.
In addition to serving as a defence measure, STAK AAG
also aims to promote the exchange of information
between ABN AMRO Group on the one hand and holders
of depositary receipts and shareholders on the other.
It also promotes the acquisition of voting instructions
from DR holders, for example by organising a meeting
of depositary receipt holders prior to ABN AMRO Group’s
General Meeting. STAK AAG will also report on its
activities at least once a year in its annual report.
In addition, further sell-downs of NLFI’s shareholding
in ABN AMRO Group will take place through STAK AAG
(and in the form of depositary receipts) only.
The Trust Conditions of STAK AAG state that it will ensure
that, no later than two weeks before a General Meeting of
ABN AMRO Group is held, a meeting of depositary receipt
holders is held at which the agenda items of that General
Meeting will be discussed. Accordingly, STAK AAG held
meetings of depositary receipt holders on 6 February
2018, 3 May 2018 and 25 June 2018.
The STAK AAG website (stakaag.org) provides more
information on the activities of STAK AAG, as well as its
annual report, articles of association (including STAK AAG’s
objectives), the Trust Conditions and any information
relating to meetings of depositary receipt holders.
Two periodic meetings were held between ABN AMRO
and STAK AAG in 2018. In addition to the introduction of
newly appointed STAK AAG board members, the items

Leadership & governance
Leadership & governance / General Meeting and shareholder structure
discussed included the published financial results, the
refreshed long-term strategy and the intended governance
in the event of hostile bids and shareholder activism.
Anti-takeover measures
ABN AMRO has implemented a structure whereby
STAK AAG is the holder of shares in ABN AMRO Group’s
issued share capital and has issued depositary receipts
representing such shares with the cooperation of
ABN AMRO Group. The purpose of having a structure
under which depositary receipts are created and
STAK AAG is the legal owner of the underlying shares
is to create a defence measure.
STAK AAG will do everything in its power to deter any
action that could affect the independence, continuity or
identity of ABN AMRO. In a non-hostile situation,
STAK AAG will act primarily in the interests of depositary
receipt holders. In a hostile situation, STAK AAG will act
primarily in the interests of ABN AMRO Group and its
business enterprises. Under all circumstances STAK AAG
will also take into account the legitimate interests of all
other stakeholders: clients, savers and deposit holders,
shareholders, depositary receipt holders, employees, and
the society in which ABN AMRO operates.
In a non-hostile situation, STAK AAG will grant a power of
attorney to the holders of depositary receipts to exercise
the voting rights attached to the underlying shares.
STAK AAG will not exercise voting rights on the shares,
unless holders of depositary receipts have requested it to
do so. This may be different under hostile circumstances
as described in section 2:118a of the Dutch Civil Code.
In this case, STAK AAG may refuse or revoke powers
of attorney for up to two years (whereby NLFI must preapprove this decision by STAK AAG as long as NLFI holds
at least 33 1/3% of the shares in ABN AMRO Group). In
this case, STAK AAG will vote itself. In doing so, it should,
pursuant to the Trust Conditions and the articles of
association of STAK AAG, focus primarily on ABN AMRO’s
interests, taking into account the legitimate interests of
the stakeholders mentioned above.
Employee Council
ABN AMRO’s employees are represented by works
councils (ondernemingsraden) at all levels of its group
in which specifically appointed delegates are centralised in
the overarching Employee Council (Raad van Medewerkers).
Under Dutch law, the managing board of any company
running an enterprise where a works council has been
established must seek the non-binding advice of the
works council before taking certain decisions with respect
to the enterprise, such as those related to a major
restructuring, a change of control, or the appointment or
dismissal of a member of the managing board. Certain
other decisions directly involving employment matters that
apply either to all employees or certain groups of
employees may only be taken with the works council’s
consent.
The Employee Council deals primarily with topics that
affect all parts of the group’s organisation and meets
regularly with members of the Executive Board and
Supervisory Board on various other occasions throughout
the year, including an annual joint meeting of the
Executive Committee, the Supervisory Board and the
Employee Council. The Employee Council and
ABN AMRO Group have entered into an agreement under
which the Employee Council has been granted certain
additional rights (the Works Council Covenant). Under the
Works Council Covenant, the Employee Council has the
right of inquiry (enquêterecht) within the meaning of
Section 2:346 of the Dutch Civil Code in the event of a
hostile situation. The Works Council Covenant defines the
following situations as hostile: (i) a public offer has been
announced or is made in respect of shares in the capital of
ABN AMRO Group (or in respect of depositary receipts
representing such shares) or there is a justified
expectation that this will take place, without agreement
first having been reached between the bidder and
ABN AMRO Group, (ii) the exercise of the voting rights
by a depositary receipt holder or shareholder would
effectively be in conflict with the interests of
ABN AMRO Group and its business, or (iii) any other
situation in which the independence, continuity or identity
of ABN AMRO Group and the enterprises associated with
ABN AMRO Group could be harmed. Other situations can
be qualified as hostile by means of an agreement
between the Employee Council and ABN AMRO Group.
Furthermore, if NLFI requests the consent, cooperation
and/or a position statement of ABN AMRO Group in the
event of a subsequent placement or a private sale of
shares or depositary receipts, the Employee Council will
be requested by ABN AMRO Group to provide advice
within the meaning of articles 25 and 26 of the Works
Councils Act (Wet op de Ondernemingsraden).

Leadership & governance / Codes and regulations 141
ABN AMRO Group is required to comply with a wide
variety of governance codes and regulations. This includes
the Dutch Corporate Governance Code, the Banking
Code and CRD IV. This section explains how
ABN AMRO Group complies with these codes and
regulations. More comprehensive overviews of
ABN AMRO Group’s compliance with such codes and
regulations are published under the Corporate Governance
section on abnamro.com.
Dutch Corporate Governance
We believe that corporate governance that meets high
international standards significantly boosts the confidence
of the stakeholders in a company. Compliance with the
applicable corporate governance codes by financial
institutions is an important basis for restoring trust in
the financial sector as a whole. Since depositary receipts
for shares in ABN AMRO Group are listed on Euronext
Amsterdam, ABN AMRO Group is required to adhere
to the Dutch Corporate Governance Code.
ABN AMRO Group has complied with all principles and
best practices of the Dutch Corporate Governance Code,
except for the deviations and nuances described below.
Under the Corporate Governance section on its website,
ABN AMRO Group also publishes a detailed ‘comply or
explain’ list with regard to the Corporate Governance Code
applicable in 2018.
Best practice provision 1.3.6 is not applicable as
ABN AMRO does have an internal audit function.
ABN AMRO Group applies principle 2.7 and best practice
provisions 2.7.1 through 2.7.4, which deal with actual and
apparent conflicts of interest. However,
ABN AMRO Group makes an exception with respect to
qualitative conflicts of interest (kwalitatief tegenstrijdige
belangen) that are exclusively the result of the identical
composition of the Executive Boards of ABN AMRO Bank
and ABN AMRO Group, and the Supervisory Boards of
the respective entities.
ABN AMRO applies best practice provision 2.1.9, which
states that the chairman of the supervisory board should
not be a former member of the management board of the
company. Although Mr Tom de Swaan was a member of
the Managing Board of the former ABN AMRO, the
current ABN AMRO is the result of various legal and
operational separations and combinations, a merger and
a legal demerger that took place after the acquisition of
the former ABN AMRO Holding N.V. (the ‘former
ABN AMRO group’) by a consortium of banks in October
2007. The consortium consisted of the Royal Bank of
Scotland Group, Fortis and Banco Santander S.A (the
‘Consortium’). In October 2008, when the Fortis group
experienced financial difficulties, the Dutch State acquired
certain operations of the Fortis group, as well as Fortis’
interest in the vehicle that had acquired the former
ABN AMRO group. The current ABN AMRO Group N.V.
was newly incorporated on 18 December 2009 to hold the
operations, assets and liabilities of parts of the former
ABN AMRO group and the part of the Fortis group
acquired by the Dutch State. On 6 February 2010, the new
and current ABN AMRO Bank demerged from the former
ABN AMRO Bank N.V. into a newly incorporated entity.
The former ABN AMRO Bank N.V. was subsequently
renamed Royal Bank of Scotland N.V. On 1 July 2010, the
new ABN AMRO Bank and Fortis Bank (Nederland) N.V.
merged pursuant to a legal merger (juridische fusie),
following which the current ABN AMRO Bank was
the surviving entity (verkrijgende vennootschap) and
Fortis Bank (Nederland) N.V. was the disappearing
entity (verdwijnende vennootschap). The current
ABN AMRO Group and ABN AMRO Bank are therefore
different entities from the former ABN AMRO Holding N.V.
or former ABN AMRO Bank N.V .
ABN AMRO Group applies best practice provisions 2.2.5,
2.3.2 and 2.3.3, which set out the roles and
responsibilities of the remuneration committee and the
selection and appointment committee. Instead, however,
of having a separate remuneration committee and a
selection and nomination committee, these committees
are combined into one committee.
ABN AMRO Group applies best practice provision 4.1.3,
which states, among other things, that (a) each substantial
change in the corporate governance structure of
ABN AMRO Group and in the compliance with the Code
and (b) material changes in the Articles of Association
should be presented to the General Meeting as a separate
discussion item or voting item, as applicable. The only
exception to this practice is that the Executive Board and
the Supervisory Board may decide to place certain topics
on the agenda under one agenda item if these topics are
justifiably related. ABN AMRO Group considers this to be
a further substantiation of this best practice provision,
which may be necessary due to the fact that a situation
could arise in which proposals to amend the Articles of
Association or the corporate governance structure of
ABN AMRO Group are interrelated in such a way that
separate votes on each of those proposals could result in
an imbalanced voting result and consequently in an
imbalance in the corporate governance structure.
Best practice provision 4.3.3 is not applicable as
ABN AMRO Group does have a statutory two-tier status
(structuurregime).

Leadership & governance / Codes and regulations
ABN AMRO Group does not apply principle 4.4.
In contradiction to this principle and provision, the issuing
of depositary receipts by STAK AAG is primarily used as
a defence measure and not to prevent a situation in which,
as a result of shareholder absenteeism, a minority of
shareholders can control the decision-making process at
a General Meeting. Regulatory considerations have been
decisive in choosing a structure with depositary receipts
as a protective measure. Declarations of No Objection
could be obtained up front only by means of a structure
with depositary receipts. These Declarations of
No Objection are required in connection with the direct
or indirect acquisition of a qualified holding in
ABN AMRO Bank and certain other regulated entities
in which ABN AMRO Group holds an interest. Therefore,
this structure provides the greatest possible certainty
of adequate protection for ABN AMRO Group against
a hostile takeover. Although the issuing of depositary
receipts has been set up primarily as a defence measure
and not to prevent absenteeism, STAK AAG aims to
promote the exchange of information between
ABN AMRO Group on the one hand and holders of
depositary receipts and shareholders on the other by,
for example, organising a meeting of depositary receipt
holders before every General Meeting. More information
on the purpose and functioning of the depositary receipts
and STAK AAG, including information on situations in
which STAK AAG may decide to limit, refuse or revoke
powers of attorney (and to not observe any voting
instructions received), can be found on the STAK AAG
website (stakaag.org).
Compliance with best practice provisions 4.4.1 through
4.4.5 and 4.4.7 through 4.4.8 are a responsibility of
the board of STAK AAG. With respect to best practice
provisions 4.4.5 and 4.4.8, the following applies. In a
non-hostile situation, STAK AAG will act primarily in the
interests of depositary receipt holders. In a hostile
situation, STAK AAG will act primarily in the interests of
ABN AMRO Group and its business enterprises. Under
all circumstances STAK AAG will also take into account
the legitimate interests of all other stakeholders: clients,
savers and deposit holders, shareholders, depositary
receipt holders, employees, and the society in which
ABN AMRO operates. Furthermore, STAK AAG has in
principle the obligation to grant a power of attorney to
depositary receipt holders to exercise the voting rights
attached to the underlying shares and will not exercise
voting rights on the shares in ABN AMRO Group (unless
depositary receipt holders have requested STAK AAG
to do so). The foregoing could be different in hostile
situations as described in Article 2:118a of the Dutch Civil
Code. STAK AAG may then decide to (a) limit, exclude or
revoke powers of attorney and (b) not observe voting
instructions received for a period of up to two years.
Furthermore, under the depositary receipt terms, when
exercising the voting rights in a hostile situation,
STAK AAG should focus primarily on the interests
of ABN AMRO Group and its business enterprises
as set out above.
Principle 5.1 and best practice provisions 5.1.1 through
5.1.5 are not applicable because ABN AMRO Group has
a two-tier board.
Dutch Banking Code
The Dutch Banking Code sets out principles that banks
with a corporate seat in the Netherlands should observe
in terms of corporate governance, risk management, audit
and remuneration. The Dutch Banking Code applies to
ABN AMRO Bank as the main entity within a group that
holds a banking licence.
ABN AMRO is therefore committed to complying with
the Dutch Banking Code and devotes a great deal of
effort to ensuring that the spirit of the code is reflected
in the behaviour of its employees and the culture
of the bank. As such, we are pleased to confirm that
ABN AMRO Group complies with the principles of the
Dutch Banking Code. A principle-by-principle overview of
the manner in which ABN AMRO Bank complied during
2018 with the Dutch Banking Code is published on
abnamro.com. Throughout 2018, we continued to improve
the manner in which we apply the principles of the Dutch
Banking Code, taking into account the focus areas
indicated by the Dutch Banking Code Monitoring
Committee. In particular, the bank devoted a great deal of
attention to leadership, integrity and its societal role,
including increased efforts regarding sustainability and
providing services to customers in their best
interests. During 2018, as part of our assessment of code
adherence, we noted that further enhancements can be
made to the processes involving succession planning,
permanent education and the self-assessments
performed at Board level. Implementation of further
enhancement of these processes has been initiated.
All members of the Supervisory Board and Executive
Board of ABN AMRO Group have taken the Banker’s Oath.
Taking this oath is required by Dutch law. The oath is a
confirmation of ABN AMRO’s existing policy, which is fully
in line with the bank’s cultural principles and core values.
Along with the introduction of a Social Charter and the
Banking Code, the Dutch banking industry has taken the
initiative to have all employees take the Banker’s Oath.
Employees take the oath to affirm their commitment to
upholding high standards of ethical behaviour. They are
personally responsible for complying with these rules of
conduct and may be held accountable for non-compliance
in the near future.

Subsidiaries of ABN AMRO Bank and the Dutch
Banking Code
On 31 December 2018, ABN AMRO Bank had four
Dutch subsidiaries with a banking licence: ABN AMRO
Clearing Bank N.V., ABN AMRO Groenbank B.V.,
ABN AMRO Hypotheken Groep B.V. and International
Card Services B.V. ABN AMRO applies the principles of
the Dutch Banking Code to all of these Dutch subsidiaries
on a consolidated basis by developing group-wide policies
and standards to promote compliance with internal and
external rules and best-practice provisions. In view,
however, of the differences between the activities,
organisation and risk management of the subsidiaries,
the application of group-wide policy and standards can
vary from one subsidiary to another. An explanation of
the manner in which these subsidiaries comply with the
Dutch Banking Code is published on abnamro.com.
CRD IV
Article 96 of CRD IV requires financial institutions to
explain on their website how they comply with the
requirements of Articles 88 through 95 of CRD IV. These
Articles set out governance, disclosure, remuneration and
nomination requirements for financial institutions. The
obligation to publish such an overview was implemented
into Dutch law by Article 134b of the Decree on Prudential
Measures FMSA (Besluit prudentiële regels Wft).
ABN AMRO has published an overview on abnamro.com
of how ABN AMRO Group and ABN AMRO Bank comply
with Article 134b of the Decree on Prudential Measures
and Article 96 of CRD IV.
Under CRD IV, all members of the management body of a
bank (including non-executive members or supervisory
board members acting in their role of overseeing and
monitoring management decision-making) must commit
sufficient time to allow them to perform their duties and
to be able to understand the bank’s business. In respect
of significant banks, such as ABN AMRO Bank, Article 91
of CRD IV contains a specific regulation on limiting the
number of executive and non-executive directorships such
members may hold (these rules have been implemented
in Dutch law in Section 3:8(3) Dutch Financial Markets
Supervision Act). All members of the Executive Board and
Supervisory Board currently comply with the above rules
under CRD IV.

Leadership & governance / Remuneration report 145
ABN AMRO’s remuneration philosophy and principles
apply to all our employees. The remuneration policy and
practices for the Supervisory Board, the Executive Board
and other Identified Staff are discussed in greater detail
in the subsequent sections of this report. 
Overview
As a financial institution ABN AMRO is subject to many
guidelines and restrictions with respect to remuneration.
Since 2015, limitations with respect to remuneration and,
more specifically, to variable remuneration have applied
to all employees in the Dutch financial sector, with even
more restrictions applying to financial institutions to which
the Dutch State provides support in the form of
shareholdings. This applies to ABN AMRO, with the
restrictions including a prohibition on bonuses for a
specific group of senior employees. ABN AMRO aims
to combine all applicable remuneration restrictions
with our corporate strategy. 
Remuneration philosophy
ABN AMRO’s long-term corporate strategy and its strategic
priorities are embedded in our remuneration policy and
principles. In 2018 this applied to the four strategic
priorities reflected in our remuneration philosophy:
Å Client-driven – Our clients’ interests come first in
everything we do;
Å Invest in the future – We need a flexible and agile
workforce and want to be an attractive employer for
which talented people are eager to work for;
Å Moderate risk profile – We adhere to all applicable
rules and regulations on remuneration and take care to
ensure that our performance criteria do not provide any
incentives for excessive risk-taking;
Å Sustainable growth – We treat our employees as our
most valuable asset. 
As ABN AMRO always aims to combine the pillars of our
corporate strategy with our remuneration philosophy, the
remuneration principles will be revisited and aligned with
the new strategy pillars from 2019 onwards. An overview
of the new strategy can be found in the Strategy chapter.
The remuneration policy applying in 2018 is described
below.
Remuneration policy
Responsible remuneration policy
ABN AMRO aims to pursue a responsible remuneration
policy that remains within the regulatory boundaries, such
as limitations on variable remuneration and the prohibition
on bonuses for a specific group of senior employees,
while taking into account the interests of all our
stakeholders and best practices. 
Our remuneration principles are embedded in
ABN AMRO’s Global Reward Policy, which is designed
to support ABN AMRO’s business strategy, objectives,
values and long-term interests. Our remuneration policy
should enable us to attract and retain the right talent and
should ensure that we can meet our responsibilities
towards clients and other stakeholders, both now and in
the future. Furthermore it provides a framework for
effectively managing reward and performance across the
bank. It is therefore periodically updated in order to remain
aligned with ABN AMRO’s goals and the applicable
guidelines and regulations. The Supervisory Board
approves the general remuneration principles laid down
in the Global Reward Policy and assesses the general
principles and exceptions that relate to the applicable
governance and/or internationally applicable guidelines
and regulations within the financial sector. The policy is
therefore regularly reviewed, taking account of the
company’s strategy and culture, and any changes in these,
and factors such as risk awareness, targets and corporate
values, as well as relevant market practice. It also takes
into account external requirements with respect to
governance, the international context and relevant
market data. 
The Global Reward Policy applies at all levels and in all
countries of ABN AMRO’s international network (including
branch offices). Different starting points apply to the
various levels of the bank’s workforce, but we always
position our remuneration levels around the median of the
relevant labour market while keeping labour costs under
control. A typical remuneration package for ABN AMRO
employees consists of an annual base salary, annual
variable remuneration if the relevant market practice so
requires, benefits and other entitlements. We also
consider specific rules with respect to those staff whose
professional activities could have a material impact on the
bank’s risk profile. Within ABN AMRO, individuals within
this group are referred to as Identified Staff.
A separate Reward Policy applies to members of
ABN AMRO’s Executive Board. This policy is in alignment
with the policy that was adopted in 2010 for the then
Managing Board. The Executive Board’s policy is aligned
with all relevant and applicable guidelines and regulations
and reflects applicable developments and
recommendations of the EBA, ECB, DNB, AFM Banking
Code and Corporate Governance Code. 
Our annual performance management cycle for Identified
Staff aims to create links between performance (realistic,
sustainable results) and reward in such a way that reward
is aligned with both the employee’s and the bank’s
performance. We use a set of balanced financial and nonfinancial targets, as well as qualitative and quantitative

KPIs. For 2018, our Group non-financial KPIs consisted of
Society at Large (based on the Dow Jones Index ranking
and the AFM/NVB Confidence Monitor Banks), Employee
Engagement (via the annual survey), the Net Promoter
Score and House in Order (conveying the desired
compliance and risk culture).The financial targets used in
2018 at Group level were revenue growth, RARORAC,
CET1 ratio and cost ceiling. Cost ceiling and RARORAC
are also used at a business line level. There is ample room
to set individual and business-related KPIs, such as
individual leadership, collaboration between business lines
and diversity targets. The table of KPIs for Identified Staff
provides more insight into the methodology used.
In line with the general trend toward less hierarchy and
more teamwork ABN AMRO wants to subject employees
to fewer checks and give them more empowerment and
to offer them the tools needed to keep them well
equipped to do their job and to deal with the ever-changing
environment. Our responsible remuneration policy should
enable our employees to further develop their expertise
and help us create a simpler, more agile organisation.
We strive to give our staff more autonomy and
responsibility, thus making their work more meaningful,
while at the same time ensuring it is aligned with all the
bank’s current and future priorities. We use Together &
Better performance management to further emphasise
our employees’ ambitions, expertise and development and
seek alignment with our goals, such as creating long-term
value for all our stakeholders.
Changes in 2018
The evaluation of the Act on the Remuneration Policy for
Financial Undertakings (Wbfo) was completed in 2018 and
followed by a public consultation on the effectiveness of
the remuneration restrictions embedded in the legislation.
The Minister of Finance has indicated a wish to impose
stricter measures regarding the use of the average 20%
variable remuneration cap, to introduce a legal obligation
to account for the relationship between remuneration and
the sector and its position in society, to introduce
mandatory requirements for board members holding
shares and to impose stricter guidelines for clawing back
fixed remuneration from board members of system banks.
Expected changes in 2019
During 2019 we will start negotiating a new Collective
Labour Agreement and will incorporate any necessary
adjustments and amendments that may follow from the
Wbfo consultation process, as well as any amendments
required owing to changes in the Banking Code. 
Remuneration principles for the Supervisory Board,
Executive Board and other Identified Staff
Supervisory Board remuneration
The remuneration of the members of the Supervisory
Board is set by the General Meeting of Shareholders,
based on a proposal of the Supervisory Board.
ABN AMRO does not grant any variable remuneration
or equity to Supervisory Board members in lieu of
remuneration. The level of remuneration has not changed
since 2010. The annual fees applicable since 2010 are
as follows:
Å Membership of Supervisory Board: EUR 50,000
(EUR 65,000 for the Chairman)
Å Membership of Audit and Risk & Capital
Committee: EUR 12,500 (EUR 15,000 for the Chairman)
Å Membership of Remuneration, Selection & Nomination
Committee: EUR 10,000 (EUR 12,500 for the
Chairman). 
The remuneration for Supervisory Board committee
membership is limited to two such memberships. Details
of the remuneration of members of the Supervisory Board
in 2018 are provided in note 35 in the Consolidated
Annual Financial Statements.
Executive Board remuneration
The Supervisory Board is responsible for proposing the
remuneration policy and principles for the Executive Board
and also executes the policy for the Executive Board.
The policy and principles are subject to shareholder
approval. The fixed remuneration for the Chairman and
three members of ABN AMRO’s Executive Board has
been set at a level slightly below that of the former CEO
and Managing Board members. The Executive Board
members’ views have not been taken into account in the
design of the remuneration policy, given the remuneration
restrictions that apply as long as the Dutch State provides
support through a shareholding.  
In the case of the former Managing Board, ABN AMRO
always aimed for a level of compensation slightly below
the median of the relevant markets. while using a peer
group of companies. This peer group consisted of both
financial and non-financial companies in the Netherlands
and Europe, against which the remuneration proposals
for the former Managing Board were assessed. In recent
years, however, the many changes that have occurred
in the banking industry in the Netherlands have made
it difficult to properly assess the Managing Board’s
remuneration packages as such changes have not
necessarily affected companies in the general industry
or the financial industry outside the Netherlands.
This currently makes benchmark comparisons difficult,
if not impossible. As in 2017, therefore, the benchmark
comparisons were not a leading factor in the process of
fixing the new Executive Board annual salaries in 2018.
These remained at the same level as in 2017 except for a
minor collective adjustment (described below). The fixed 
ABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018
Introduction Strategy and performance Risk, funding & capital Leadership Governance Annual Financial Statements Other
Leadership & governance / Remuneration report 147
remuneration for the five members of ABN AMRO’s
Executive Committee has been set on the basis of
the Executive Board salaries and reflects the various
responsibilities of the Executive Committee members.
The new salary framework of the Executive Committee
members became effective on the starting date of their
appointments, 1 March 2017.
Details of the remuneration of the individual members
of the Executive Board and of the Executive Committee
members are provided in note 35 and note 36 respectively
in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.
Annual fixed remuneration for 2018
The annual base salary for the Executive Board members
follows the developments in the Collective Labour
Agreement for the banking industry (CAO Banken). For the
year 2018, a collective salary increase of 1.5% applied. 
The three members of the Executive Board each earn the
same salary which, for 2018, amounted to EUR 614,075
gross per annum. The differential between the salary of
the Chairman of the Executive Board, Mr Kees van
Dijkhuizen, and the other members is 15%. His salary for
2018 amounted to EUR 723,358.
In February 2019, a new Collective Labour Agreement
for the banking industry was concluded for the years
2019-2020. This provides for two collective salary
increases, each of 2.5%, from 1 January 2019 and
1 January 2020 respectively.
The Chairman of the Executive Board’s 2019 salary will
be EUR 741,442 gross, while the members of the
Executive Board will each receive an annual salary of
EUR 629,427 gross. 
Variable remuneration
The remuneration package for members of the Executive
Board provides for a variable compensation component.
However, the prohibition on bonuses that became
effective in 2011 and, since 7 February 2015, has been
incorporated into Article 1:128 Financial Supervision Act
does not allow such compensation to be paid to board
members of financial institutions falling under the scope
of the Financial Supervision Act during the period the
Dutch State provides support through a shareholding
in the institution. Consequently no benchmark scenario
analysis was undertaken. The members of the Executive
Board are therefore not entitled to receive variable
remuneration during the period of state ownership.
This continued to apply in the 2018 performance year.
Executive Board members consequently do not participate
in the Variable Compensation Plan applying to all Identified
Staff within ABN AMRO. 
Benefits
The Chairman and members of the Executive Board
participate in the ABN AMRO pension schemes applicable
to all employees in the Netherlands, whereby it should
be noted that Mr Clifford Abrahams is not a Dutch tax
resident. For pensionable salary up to the applicable
threshold, which for 2018 amounted to EUR 105,075,
a collective defined contribution (CDC) pension scheme
applies. From 2018, the standard retirement age is 68,
while the average income accrual is 1.875% and the
employee pension contribution is 5.5%. For pensionable
salary in excess of EUR 105,075, employees receive an
allowance that can be used to build up a net pension in a
defined contribution (DC) plan. The allowance amounted to
34% in 2018. The allowance is set annually, based on the
year-end interest in the preceding calendar year. In
addition to pension benefits, Executive Board members
are eligible for benefits such as a company car and a
chauffeur. 
Severance 
The remuneration policy for Managing Board members
foresees in a severance payment equal to one year’s
gross salary in the event of their employment contract
being terminated at ABN AMRO’s initiative. The current
Executive Board members all have the same contractual
right to a severance payment equal to three months’ gross
fixed salary. In 2018, Mr Johan van Hall, as a former
Managing Board member, was awarded a severance
payment on his departure. Contrary to his contractual
entitlement as a former Managing Board member, the
severance payment made to Mr van Hall equalled three
months’ gross fixed salary, as applicable to the current
Executive Board members.   
Appointment period
The appointment term for Executive Board members is,
in principle, set at three years. Mr van Dijkhuizen was
appointed CEO and Chairman on 1 January 2017.
Mr Clifford Abrahams was appointed an Executive Board
member and CFO on 1 September 2017 and has acted as
Vice-Chairman since 1 March 2018 as the successor of
the former Managing Board member, Johan van Hall.
Ms Tanja Cuppen was appointed an Executive Board
member on 1 October 2017 and became CRO on
1 November 2017. Mr Christian Bornfeld was appointed
an Executive Board member and CI&TO on 1 March 2018.
The appointment terms for all current Executive Board
members have been contractually agreed to be three
years, with the appointment ending at the close of the
first General Meeting held after the three-year term has
expired. Reappointment is possible.

Executive Board 2018 performance
The Supervisory Board assessed the Executive Board
members’ performance and concluded that the set
performance targets for 2018 were well met. The average
performance outcome was above target, based on a set
of financial and non-financial performance indicators as
well as individual leadership. Owing to the applicable
prohibition on bonuses, the members of the Executive
Board are not eligible to receive variable remuneration
linked to their performance during 2018. 
Identified Staff remuneration
Remuneration restrictions apply not only to the Executive
Board, but also to those staff whose professional activities
could have a material impact on the bank’s risk profile
(‘Identified Staff’). Within ABN AMRO, the group of
Identified Staff consists of:
Å Members of the Executive and Supervisory Boards;
Å Members of the Executive Committee;
Å Members who fulfil an Executive Committee -1 or -2
position at above-CLA level;
Å Staff responsible for independent control functions;
Å Other risk takers. The definition of the group of other
risk takers follows from their impact on the economic
capital of ABN AMRO (EC threshold), membership of
certain Risk Committees, having credit authority above
a certain threshold and fulfilling specific roles; 
Å Other employees whose total remuneration takes
them into the same remuneration bracket as senior
managers and risk takers. 
Composition of remuneration packages
In general, the remuneration packages for Identified Staff
have been structured in accordance with the various
regulations and restrictions for the financial sector.
A typical remuneration package for Identified Staff
consists of the following components:
Å Annual base salary;
Å Annual variable remuneration (with deferred
payout in alignment with the ABN AMRO Variable
Compensation Plan);
Å Benefits and other entitlements.
ABN AMRO strives to position the level of total direct
compensation for the Executive Committee members and
the Executive Committee -1 and -2 positions just below
the market median levels. In alignment with the Act on
the Remuneration Policy for Financial Undertakings
(Wbfo), which came into force in 2015, the variable
compensation for this group of employees is capped at
20% of base salary for those employed in the
Netherlands. In addition, and also with effect from 2015,
the further remuneration restrictions, including the
prohibition on bonuses, were extended to a specific group
of senior employees as defined in the Wbfo. Accordingly,
these senior employees, comprising the five Executive
Committee members, are also not allowed to be granted
any variable remuneration until the Dutch State no longer
holds an interest in ABN AMRO.
ABN AMRO’s Collective Labour Agreement (CLA) governs
the remuneration packages for Identified Staff based in
the Netherlands unless they have been appointed to a
positions to which the CLA does not apply, such as the
Executive Committee -1 and -2 groups of employees.
For Identified Staff based outside the Netherlands,
ABN AMRO takes the relevant business dynamics
(e.g. market conditions, local labour and tax legislation)
into account when deciding on the composition of the
reward packages. For the latter two categories of
employees, the total direct compensation is aimed to be
positioned around the median levels in the relevant
market. The maximum variable compensation percentage
for employees working outside the Netherlands in another
European Economic Area (‘EEA’) state is 100%; for
employees working outside the EEA more than 100% is
allowed, with a maximum of 200% and subject to
shareholder approval. These percentages are aligned to
the international market environment in which we operate.  
Until 14 December 2018 (the date on which the Private
Equity Business was sold), special plans existed for
certain key investment professionals within Private Equity.
Key investment professionals were able to participate in
private equity funds where separate performance-related
incentives (‘carried interest’) had been agreed upon.
Carried interest became payable only after the relevant
private equity fund had first returned all the capital
contributed by ABN AMRO plus an amount of profits at
an agreed hurdle rate. Carried interest entitlement was
awarded at the initiation of the private equity fund
controlled by ABN AMRO. The value of this entitlement
over the paid-up amount by the investment professionals
was treated as variable compensation at the time of being
granted. Subsequent changes in value were treated as
third-party minority interests in the funds and reflected
as other non-controlling interests in the consolidated
income statement (see page 154). We also refer to the
consolidated statement of changes in equity on page 157.
Carried interest was subject to ‘good and bad leaver’
arrangements, as set out in the relevant agreement, to
discourage malfeasance. Claw-back provisions were also
in place. Due to the sale of the Private Equity business,
the carried interest schemes no longer exist at
ABN AMRO.
Performance is measured during a one-year performance
period at three levels: group, business unit and individual
level, and by means of (partly) risk-adjusted financial and

Deferred cash2
1
 The up-front payment (60% in total) is awarded in March following the relevant
 performance year.
2
 The deferred award (40% in total) vests in three separate tranches respectively
 1, 2 and 3 years after the end of the relevant performance year.
3
 All non-cash awards are subject to a two year retention period.
Up-front variable remuneration is awarded in the first
quarter of the year following the relevant performance
year, while deferred variable remuneration vests in equal
instalments in the three years following the first payment.
This remuneration will vest only after an explicit ex-post
risk assessment: the ‘malus assessment’ (see the ex-post
risk adjustment tools paragraph).
The Supervisory Board approval of the new Variable
Compensation Plan on is expected mid March 2019.
Since the awards reflecting the 2016 performance year,
the instrument underlying the non-cash award has
consisted of an award in the form of a Depositary Receipt
(DR) Award, which is a conditional right to receive DRs.
One DR represents one share in ABN AMRO. The value
therefore fluctuates in line with the market price of the
DRs and its use will result in an increased alignment
between remuneration and shareholder value for all
participants in the Variable Compensation Plan.
Variable remuneration of Identified Staff
All variable remuneration awards for Identified Staff are
subject to, and structured in accordance with, the Variable
Compensation Plan. Before any variable remuneration is
granted, ABN AMRO applies an ex-ante risk assessment
consisting of collective quantitative risk adjustment
mechanisms (such as the solvency check) and a qualitative
individual check (the gatekeeper). The gatekeeper
procedure forms part of the performance management
framework and provides for an assessment of each
individual Identified Staff member by the control functions
(Risk, Compliance and Audit) on the basis of several
behavioural elements. This assessment results in advice
to the Executive Board, which ultimately decides on
whether variable compensation can indeed be granted to
the Identified Staff member concerned. The Executive
Board’s decision must be formally approved by the
Supervisory Board, based on the advice of the
Remuneration, Selection & Nomination Committee. For
2018 it was decided not to apply gatekeeper adjustments.
The variable remuneration is awarded over time and split
between an up-front portion (60%) and a deferred portion
(40%), with all portions divided equally between a cash
and a non-cash instrument, as shown in the following chart.

Leadership & governance / Remuneration report
Variable income awards with respect to the performance
years up to and including 2015 will continue to use
performance certificates, the value of which fluctuates in
line with the net asset value of ABN AMRO.
A two-year retention period applies to the non-cash
instruments. Any unconditional instrument will therefore
need to be retained for a further two years.
The malus assessment is conducted by the Risk,
Compliance, HR, Finance and Audit control functions,
and any outcome is subject to approval by the Executive
Board and Supervisory Board. This assessment includes
determining whether any new information is available that
prevents the vesting of deferred remuneration.  
This could include:
Evidence of misconduct or serious error by the staff
member (e.g. breach of a code of conduct or other internal
rules, especially concerning risks);
Å The institution or the business unit subsequently
suffers a significant downturn in its financial
performance (specific indicators must be used);
Å The institution or the business unit in which the
Identified Staff member works suffers a significant
failure of risk management;
Å Significant changes in the institution’s economic or
regulatory capital base.
The Supervisory Board decided that, on the basis of the
reassessment performed by the control functions, there
was no reason to apply a collective malus with respect to
the vesting of:
Å the third tranche of deferred variable compensation for
the 2015 performance period;
Å the second tranche of deferred variable compensation
for the 2016 performance period;
Å the first tranche of deferred variable compensation for
the 2017 performance period. 
In five individual cases, the Supervisory Board decided to
apply a malus with respect to the vesting of any remaining
deferred variable compensation for the 2015 and 2016
performance period. This affects two employees for a
total outstanding amount of EUR 36 thousand.
The other deferred variable compensation awards with
respect to the above three performance years will now be
granted to the relevant Identified Staff members in line
with the rules of the Variable Compensation Plan. 
The Supervisory Board has discretionary power to reduce
any variable compensation to a suitable amount if, in its
opinion, payment of the compensation would be
unacceptable under the principle of reasonableness and
fairness. The Supervisory Board is also authorised to
reclaim any variable remuneration for any performance
period if the award, calculation or payment was based on
incorrect data or if, in hindsight, the performance
conditions were not achieved. The recipient will then be
obliged to repay the relevant amount to the bank.
Lastly, personal hedging or insurance linked to
remuneration and liability in order to circumvent the risk
control effects that have been embedded in the variable
compensation plan is not permitted.  
Details of remuneration

The ratio of the mean annual employee compensation and
the total annual remuneration of the CEO in 2018 was 9.6,
slightly lower than in 2017. The ratio is calculated as the
CEO’s remuneration, including pension costs, divided by
the mean employee remuneration and pension costs for
the average number of employees during 2018. This ratio
is considered to be a fair reflection of ABN AMRO’s
current position. The ratios published in 2016 and 2017
were 11.4 and 10 respectively.

The 2018 opening balance was adjusted due to the impact of IFRS 9. The impact of the IFRS 9 implementation on total
equity is EUR 319 million. The current year’s net profit was added to retained earnings for an amount of EUR 2,207 million.
A dividend payment to the owners of the parent company impacted equity with a total amount of EUR 1,363 million.
Other non-controlling interest decreased as a result of the deconsolidation of the ABN AMRO Participaties Funds that
were sold in December 2018.

The opening balance of accumulated other comprehensive income was impacted by the implementation of IFRS 9
for EUR 104 million. The total movement in accumulated other comprehensive income for 2018 was EUR 471 million
(2017: EUR 323 million). The main cause of this movement is related to the movement in the cash flow hedge reserve
(EUR 243 million), the fair value reserve (EUR 164 million) and the accumulated share of OCI of associates and joint
ventures (EUR 137 million). The deferred tax related to accumulated other comprehensive income was impacted by
the substantively enacted future change in corporate income tax percentages in the Netherlands.

The cash position increased with a total of EUR 3.2 billion, and including EUR 31 million related to foreign currency
translation differences. The non-cash activities were mostly impacted by movements in the fair value reserve, cash flow
hedge reserve, foreign currency translation and interest accruals. The operating activities fluctuated mostly as a result
of changes in derivatives, securities financing and due to banks. The variance in the investing activities was mostly
attributable to purchases, sale and redemptions of financial investments. The proceeds from issuance of debt resulted
in a total cash flow of EUR 40.2 billion, which was largely offset by the repayment of issued debt by EUR 36.4 billion.
The dividend paid to ordinary shareholders of the parent company resulted in a total cash flow of EUR 1.4 billion.

Annual Financial Statements
1 Accounting policies
The notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements, including the audited information in the Risk, funding &
capital section, are an integral part of these Annual Financial Statements. This section describes ABN AMRO Group’s
significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates or judgements relating to the Annual Financial
Statements. If an accounting policy or a critical accounting estimate relates to a specific note, it is included within
the relevant note.
Corporate information
ABN AMRO Group N.V. (referred to as ABN AMRO Group or the parent company) is the parent company of
ABN AMRO Bank N.V. and a related consolidated group of companies (referred to as the Group or ABN AMRO).
ABN AMRO Group is a public limited liability company, incorporated under Dutch law on 18 December 2009, and
registered at Gustav Mahlerlaan 10, 1082 PP Amsterdam, the Netherlands (Chamber of Commerce number 34370515).
As at 31 December 2018, all shares in the capital of ABN AMRO Group were held by two foundations: NLFI and
STAK AAG. On that date, NLFI held 56.3% in ABN AMRO, of which 49.9% is directly held via ordinary shares and 6.4%
is indirectly held via depositary receipts for shares in ABN AMRO. STAK AAG held 50.1% of the shares in the issued
capital of ABN AMRO Group N.V. Both foundations have issued depositary receipts for shares in ABN AMRO Group.
Only STAK AAG’s depositary receipts are issued with the cooperation of ABN AMRO Group and traded on Euronext
Amsterdam.
ABN AMRO provides a broad range of financial services to retail, private and corporate banking clients. These activities
are conducted primarily in the Netherlands and selectively abroad.
The Consolidated Annual Financial Statements of ABN AMRO Group for the annual period ended 31 December 2018
incorporate financial information of ABN AMRO Group N.V., its controlled entities, interests in associates and joint
ventures. The Annual Financial Statements were prepared by the Executive Board and authorised for issue by the
Supervisory Board and Executive Board on 12 March 2019.
Statement of compliance
The Consolidated Annual Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS), as endorsed by the European Union (EU). They also comply with the financial reporting requirements
included in Title 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code, as far as applicable.
Basis of preparation
The Consolidated Annual Financial Statements are prepared on a historical cost basis, except for derivative financial
instruments, financial assets and liabilities held for trading or designated as measured at fair value through profit or loss,
financial instruments not held in a hold to collect business model, debt instruments that do not meet the solely
payments of principal and interest (SPPI) test, and equity investments in associates of a private equity nature, all of
which are measured at fair value. The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that are hedged items in fair
value hedges, and otherwise carried at amortised cost, are adjusted to record changes in fair value attributable to the
risks that are being hedged. Associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method.
On 13 February 2019, ABN AMRO announced its intention to simplify the group structure by executing a legal merger
between ABN AMRO Bank N.V. (ABN AMRO Bank) and ABN AMRO Group N.V. (ABN AMRO Group). As a result of the
proposed merger, ABN AMRO Group will cease to exist. Shareholders in ABN AMRO Group will consequently become
shareholders in ABN AMRO Bank, while shares in ABN AMRO Bank will be represented by depositary receipts, through
which the listing on Euronext Amsterdam will be retained. Holders of debt instruments will continue to hold instruments
issued by ABN AMRO Bank. The legal merger has no material effect on equity. Subject to all the necessary approvals,
including regulatory approvals, the merger is expected to be executed during 2019. The activities of ABN AMRO Group
will be integrated and continued in ABN AMRO Bank. Therefore the Annual Financial Statements are prepared under the
going concern assumption.

Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements
The Annual Financial Statements are presented in euros, which is the reporting currency of ABN AMRO, rounded to the
nearest million (unless otherwise stated).
Changed presentation of due to banks and due to customers
In 2018 ABN AMRO changed presentation of deposits included in due to banks (see note 26) and due to customers (see
note 27) to better align with regulatory guidance and market practices.
The change in presentation did not impact the measurement of these line items, retained earnings or the result for any
period. The comparative figures have been adjusted accordingly. As a result, the following definitions apply to the new
presentation of due to banks and due to customers:
Å Current accounts include amounts held at ABN AMRO which are available to the owner for the execution of payment
transactions.
Å Demand deposits are available to the account owner for frequent and immediate access, but cannot be used for
payment transactions. As these deposits are on demand, they can be drawn or transferred by the client without prior
notice to the bank.
Å Time deposits are not available to the account owner for immediate access and have an agreed maturity. In special
circumstances, early withdrawal may be permitted at a penalty payable by the account owner.
Å Cash collateral on securities lent includes payables for cash collateral received in derivatives transactions.
The table below provides an overview of the changed presentation of due to banks and due to customers following from
the new definitions applied:

Current accounts have been redefined to include products that were previously reported under demand deposits.
Saving deposits are recorded under demand deposits and time deposits.
Reclassification of unsettled securities transactions
As at 1 January 2018, ABN AMRO reclassified all unsettled securities transactions previously included in securities
financing as other assets and other liabilities. These assets were reclassified to reflect their nature as they comprise
unsettled securities transactions and therefore do not necessarily relate to securities financing. As at 1 January 2018,
EUR 1.0 billion of assets were reclassified from securities financing to other assets, while liabilities totalling
EUR 1.5 billion were reclassified from securities financing to other liabilities. The comparative figures have been
adjusted accordingly.

Reclassification for interest income related to derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting
In 2018, ABN AMRO changed the presentation of interest income from derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting from
‘Interest income from financial instruments measured at amortised cost and fair value through other comprehensive
income’ to ‘Interest income from financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss’. The comparatives
have been adjusted accordingly. The interest income has been reclassified due to the amendment that IFRS 9 made to
IAS 1. For the year 2018, EUR 1.9 billion has been reclassified (2017: EUR 1.9 billion).
Restatement of committed credit facilities
During the second half of 2018 ABN AMRO assessed the application of its definitions relating to committed and
uncommitted credit facilities. This resulted in an increase in committed credit facilities. Adjusting the comparative figures
resulted in an increase of EUR 22.5 billion as at 31 December 2017. The change did not impact retained earnings, the
result or the total assets and liabilities for any period.
Disclosures
To combine disclosures, and to reduce duplication, we have integrated some IFRS disclosures into our Executive Board
report. These are:
Å IFRS 7 Risk disclosures of financial instruments. These are disclosed in the Risk, funding and capital section;
Å IAS 1 Capital disclosures. These are part of the Risk, funding and capital section.
IFRS disclosures in the Risk, funding and capital section are labelled as ‘audited’. These disclosures are an integral part
of the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements and are covered by the Auditor’s report.
Changes in accounting policies
New EU-endorsed standards became effective as at 1 January 2018. The following standards were adopted:
IFRS 9 Financial instruments
ABN AMRO adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments as at 1 January 2018. IFRS 9 was issued by the IASB in July 2014 and
endorsed by the EU in November 2016. ABN AMRO has applied the principles of IFRS 9 retrospectively from 1 January
2018 onwards. Prior years have not been restated in line with the transitional provisions of the standard. IFRS 9 replaces
IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and includes requirements for the classification and
measurement (C&M) of financial instruments, impairment of financial assets, and hedge accounting.
ABN AMRO has decided to continue applying IAS 39 for hedge accounting and the application of the EU carve-out. See
the IFRS 9 transition disclosures in this note for details of the transitional impact of IFRS 9.
Classification and measurement
The classification and measurement of financial assets under IFRS 9 is determined by the business model in which the
assets are held and whether the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI). Under IFRS
9, financial assets can be measured at amortised cost, fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI) or fair
value through profit or loss (FVTPL). These categories replace the IAS 39 classifications of loans and receivables (L&R),
available-for-sale (AFS), FVTPL, and held-to-maturity.
As part of the transition to IFRS 9, ABN AMRO has performed an analysis of the business models and contractual cash
flows of all financial asset portfolios. This has resulted in a number of changes. Additional information on these changes
is provided in the IFRS 9 transition disclosure.
Classification and measurement of financial liabilities has largely remained unchanged except for financial liabilities
measured at FVTPL. Changes in fair value attributable to changes in the credit risk of such liabilities are presented in
other comprehensive income. This resulted in a transfer from retained earnings to accumulated other comprehensive
income as at 1 January 2018. The cumulative amount of changes in fair value attributable to the credit risk of issued debt
is presented as liability own credit risk reserve in equity.
The IFRS 9 classification and measurement accounting policies of ABN AMRO are explained in the section on significant
accounting policies in this note.

Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements
Impairments
IFRS 9 replaced the incurred loss model with the expected credit loss (ECL) model, which is designed to be forwardlooking. The IFRS 9 impairment requirements are applicable to financial assets measured at amortised cost and FVOCI.
Additionally, the scope of the IFRS 9 impairment requirements is broader than under IAS 39 as loan commitments
and financial guarantee contracts are also included. The financial instruments in scope of the IFRS 9 impairment
requirements are divided into three groups, depending on the stage of credit quality deterioration:
Å Financial instruments without a significant increase in credit risk (stage 1): the portion of the lifetime expected credit
losses associated with default events occurring in the next twelve months (12M ECL) is recognised. Interest income
is recognised based on the gross carrying amount;
Å Financial instruments with significantly increased credit risk (stage 2): lifetime expected credit loss (LECL) is
recognised. Interest income is recognised based on the gross carrying amount;
Å Credit-impaired financial instruments (stage 3): these financial instruments are defaulted and consequently a LECL
is recognised. Interest income is recognised based on the amortised cost.
Reference is made to the Credit risk management section for information on ABN AMRO’s impairment policy.
Transition to IFRS 9
This section provides insight into the impact of the transition to IFRS 9 on the consolidated statement of financial
position at the transition date of 1 January 2018. The impact is the result of specific changes attributable to new
classification and measurement requirements, combined with an increase in the allowances for expected credit losses
following the new impairment requirements.
In the case of other off-balance sheet items, which mainly consist of revocable loan commitments, ABN AMRO
reclassified the provisions for these items from Loans and advances customers to Provisions.
The following tables reconcile the carrying amounts under IAS 39 with the carrying amounts under IFRS 9 and show
the impact (net of tax) on shareholders’ equity and total equity attributable to the transition to IFRS 9 on 1 January 2018.

1 This column includes the reclassification of previously embedded derivatives to Corporate loans at FVTPL.
a. Certain portfolios of corporate loans have embedded derivatives that were bifurcated under IAS 39. These are loans where the return is based on the price of underlying
commodity contracts or loans with a floating interest rate, and where the interest reset period does not match the interest reference rate. These contracts were analysed in
their entirety in accordance with IFRS 9 and failed the solely payment of principal and interest (SPPI) criterion. As a result, the loans, together with the embedded derivatives
that were previously bifurcated, were reclassified as FVTPL at 1 January 2018. The amounts relating to the reclassification are EUR 1,929 million for loans, EUR 141 million
for derivatives assets and EUR 25 million for derivatives liabilities. As the fair value of these loans is EUR 33 million below their carrying amount under IAS 39, this has resulted
in a C&M remeasurement.
b. ABN AMRO has chosen not to select the FVOCI option under IFRS 9 for all equity securities. As a result, an amount of EUR 415 million has been reclassified from availablefor-sale (AFS) under IAS 39 to FVTPL under IFRS 9. In addition, the cumulative AFS reserve of EUR 42 million (net of tax) relating to these equity securities reclassified to FVTPL
has been transferred to retained earnings. All AFS debt instruments were remeasured at FVOCI.
c. For a portfolio of corporate loans that had been reclassified from held for trading to loans and receivables in 2015, a revised amortised cost measurement has been applied in
accordance with IFRS 9, as if these loans had always been measured at amortised cost. This resulted in a reduction in the carrying amounts of these loans at 1 January 2018,
reflected as a C&M remeasurement of EUR 190 million negative in the above table.
d. The IFRS 9 impairment requirements resulted in ECL remeasurement of total assets by EUR 92 million and of total liabilities by EUR 61 million, largely as a result of a
EUR 141 million impact on loans and advances to customers and a EUR 52 million increase in tax assets. Allowances for irrevocable loan commitments and financial
guarantees are included in provisions.
e. The tax effect recognised in tax assets is EUR 108 million.
f. IFRS 9 changes the measurement criteria for financial liabilities designated as FVTPL, as a result of which the cumulative change in the fair value attributable to changes
in the credit risk of that liability are presented in accumulated other comprehensive income. This change resulted in the transfer of EUR 64 million (net of tax) from retained
earnings to accumulated other comprehensive income at 1 January 2018.
g. Allowances for credit losses of EUR 2 million on FVOCI instruments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. These allowances for credit losses have
no effect on the carrying value of FVOCI financial assets, which continue to be measured at fair value. The adoption of IFRS 9 resulted in a transfer of EUR 2 million from
the fair value reserve to retained earnings to reflect the cumulative impairment recognised in profit or loss.

1 This includes the impact of IFRS 9 on minority interest calculation.
The transition to IFRS 9 has resulted in a decline in RWA-based capital ratios and leverage ratios. This impact is
attributable to classification and measurement changes and risk-weighting of the related potential future tax savings.
In addition, the allowances for credit losses have increased due to IFRS 9, but the regulatory capital impact was more
than offset by a reversal in the IRB Provision Shortfall. Transition to IFRS 9 has resulted in a decrease of CET1 capital
by 12bps.
The regulatory transitional arrangements which allow for gradual phasing-in of the negative impact on own funds will not
be applied by ABN AMRO due to the limited expected impact on CET1 capital. If future IFRS 9 credit loss allowances
increase significantly, ABN AMRO may apply the transitional provisions, subject to prior permission from the ECB.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
The IFRS 15 standard became effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. It establishes
a comprehensive framework for determining the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue from contracts with
customers.
After contracts and their performance obligations have been identified, revenue is recognised as an amount that reflects
the consideration to which the bank expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to
customers. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation. Revenue is recognised when a promised
good or service is transferred to the customer, either at a point in time or over time. ABN AMRO elected to apply the
modified retrospective approach in the transition to the new standard and uses practical expedients where applicable.
The standard introduced enhanced disclosures on fee and commission income, and had no further impact on
ABN AMRO’s financial statements and comparative figures.

Annual Financial Statements
Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements
IFRS 2 Share-based Payments
In June 2016 the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 2 Share-based Payments: Classification and Measurement of
Share-based Payment Transactions. This comprised three amendments that clarify how to account for certain types of
share-based payment transactions. As ABN AMRO does not currently have any IFRS 2 share-based payment plans,
this amendment does not impact on ABN AMRO.
Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2014-2016 Cycle
This cycle of annual improvements comprises three amendments, one of which became effective on 1 January 2017.
This amendment relates to IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities and provides clarifications on the scope of
the standard. The other two amendments became effective on 1 January 2018. Neither amendment, IFRS 1 relating to
First-Time Adoption and IAS 28 relating to Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures, had an impact on the financial
statements.
New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet effective
The following amendments to IFRS have been issued by the IASB and endorsed by the EU, but are not yet effective.
ABN AMRO does not early apply these amendments. Note that only the amendments to IFRS that are relevant for
ABN AMRO are discussed.
IFRS 16 Leases
The new standard on leases was issued by the IASB in January 2016 and became effective on 1 January 2019.
IFRS 16 replaces IAS 17 Leases and removes the distinction between ‘operating’ and ‘finance’ leases for lessees.
The requirements for lessor accounting remain largely unchanged.
The main impact of IFRS 16 on ABN AMRO’s financial statements is expected to arise from leases of office buildings
and cars which the bank leases for its own use as lessee. ABN AMRO has elected to apply the modified retrospective
approach in the transition to the new standard and will use several of the practical expedients. The transition to IFRS 16
is estimated to result in an increase in assets and liabilities of approximately EUR 0.3 billion. The expected impact on
equity is not significant. Additional disclosures regarding both the lessor and lessee lease portfolios will be included in
the 2019 financial statements.
Amendments to IFRS 9
The IASB issued amendments to IFRS 9, Prepayment Features with Negative Compensation, which became effective
on 1 January 2019. These amendments allow instruments with symmetric prepayment options to be measured at
amortised cost or at fair value through other comprehensive income. As ABN AMRO does not currently have any
financial instruments with these features, these amendments do not have an impact.
IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
In October 2017, the IASB issued amendments to IAS 28 that will become effective on 1 January 2019. The amendments
state that IFRS 9 should be applied to long-term interests in an associate or joint venture to which the equity method is
not applied. Based on our initial analysis, no impact on ABN AMRO is expected.
New standards, amendments and interpretations not yet endorsed
The following new or revised standards and amendments have been issued by the IASB, but have not yet been
endorsed by the EU and are therefore not open for early adoption. Note that only the amendments to IFRS that are
relevant for ABN AMRO are discussed.
Annual Improvements 2015-2017 Cycle
In December 2017, the IASB issued the Annual Improvements to IFRS Standards 2015-2017 Cycle. These amendments
are required to be applied for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019. This cycle of annual improvements
comprises amendments relating to IFRS 3 Business Combinations, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements, IAS 12 Income Taxes
and IAS 23 Borrowing Costs. The impact of the amendments on the financial statements is expected to be insignificant.
IFRS 3 Business Combinations
In October 2018 the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 3 Business Combinations. The amendments resolve difficulties in
determining whether an entity has acquired a business or a group of assets. The amendments are effective for business
combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after 1 January 2020. ABN AMRO is currently assessing the impact
of the amendments.

Introduction Strategy and performance Risk, funding & capital Leadership Governance Annual Financial Statements Other
Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements 171
Definition of Material (IAS 1 and IAS 8)
In October 2018 the IASB issued amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements and IAS 8 Accounting
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors. The amendments revise the definition of material and align the
definition across other IFRS publications. ABN AMRO is currently assessing the impact of the amendments.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying
ABN AMRO’s accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. Actual results may
differ from those estimates and assumptions. Accounting policies for the most significant areas requiring management
to make judgements and estimates that affect reported amounts and disclosures are made in the following sections:
Impairment losses on loans and advances Risk, funding & capital section
Fair value of financial instruments note 18
Income tax expense, tax assets and tax liabilities  note 10
Impairment of instruments measured at FVOCI  note 16
Provisions      note 29
Impairment of goodwill note 23
Assessment of risks, rewards and control
Whenever ABN AMRO is required to assess risks, rewards and control, when considering the recognition and
derecognition of assets or liabilities and the consolidation or deconsolidation of subsidiaries, it may sometimes be
required to use judgement. Although management uses its best knowledge of current events and actions in making
such assessments, the actual risks, rewards and control may ultimately differ.
Significant accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
The Consolidated Annual Financial Statements of ABN AMRO Group N.V. include the financial statements of the parent
company and its controlled entities, thus incorporating the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of
ABN AMRO Group N.V. and its subsidiaries. Non-controlling interests (held by third parties) in both equity and
results of group companies are presented separately in the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements.
Subsidiaries are included using the same reporting period and consistent accounting policies. Intercompany balances and
transactions, and any related unrealised gains and losses, are eliminated in preparing the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities are eliminated to the extent
of ABN AMRO’s interest in the entities. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence
of impairment in the asset transferred.
Foreign currency
ABN AMRO applies IAS 21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates. Transactions in foreign currencies are
translated into euros at the rate prevailing on the transaction date. Foreign currency balances of monetary items are
translated into euros at the period-end exchange rates. Exchange gains and losses on such balances are recognised in
the income statement.
The Consolidated Annual Financial Statements are stated in euros, which is the presentation and functional currency
of ABN AMRO. The Group’s foreign operations may have different functional currencies. The functional currency is the
currency that best reflects the economic substance of the underlying event and circumstances relevant to that entity.
Prior to consolidation (or equity accounting), the assets and liabilities of non-euro operations are translated at the closing
rate, and items in the income statement and other comprehensive income are translated into euros at the rate prevailing
on the transaction dates. Exchange differences arising on the translation of foreign operations are included in the
currency translation reserve within equity. These are transferred to the income statement when the Group loses control,
joint control or significant influence over the foreign operation.
Financial assets and liabilities
Classification and measurement of financial assets (applicable from 1 January 2018)
Under IFRS 9, ABN AMRO classifies financial assets based on the business model in which they are held. The business
model is determined at a portfolio level. Portfolios are based on how ABN AMRO as a group manages financial assets in

Annual Financial Statements
Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements
order to achieve a particular business objective. The business model assessment is based on the level of sales, risk
management, performance evaluation and management compensation. Derecognition is used as a condition to
determine whether a transaction results in a sale.
Three business models are distinguished:
Å ‘Hold to collect’ business model, in which cash flows are primarily generated by collecting contractual cash flows
until maturity of the financial instrument. Sales can occur, as long as they are incidental, infrequent and insignificant.
The assessment of the frequency and significance of sales is determined for each underlying portfolio. Sales that
result from increases in the credit risk of the counterparty or take place close to maturity do not contradict the
‘hold to collect’ business model.
Å ‘Hold to collect and sell’ business model, in which the selling of financial assets is integral to achieving the business
objective. In this business model, sales take place more frequently and have a greater value than in a business model
with an objective to hold to collect.
Å ‘Other’ business models not meeting the criteria of the business models mentioned above, for example business
models in which financial assets are managed with the objective of generating cash flows from sales (trading book)
are managed on a fair value basis. Under these business models, the financial assets are measured at FVTPL.
After the business model has been determined, the contractual cash flows of financial assets are assessed.
Debt instruments can be classified at amortised cost or FVOCI only when the contractual cash flows are solely
payments of principal and interest (SPPI). Contractual cash flows that are SPPI are consistent with a basic lending
arrangement in which consideration for the time value of money and credit risk are typically the most significant interest
elements. Debt instruments that do not meet the SPPI requirements are mandatorily measured at FVTPL. Financial
assets are assessed in their entirety, including any embedded derivatives that are not separated from the host contract.
Based on the business model determined and the SPPI assessment, the following measurement categories are
identified under IFRS 9:
Å Amortised cost – Financial instruments measured at amortised cost are debt instruments within a hold to collect
business model with fixed or determinable payments which meet the SPPI criteria. These instruments are initially
measured at fair value (including transaction costs) and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective
interest rate method, with the periodic amortisation recorded in the income statement. Financial instruments
measured at amortised cost are presented net of credit loss allowances in the Statement of financial position.
Å FVTPL – Financial instruments measured at FVTPL include instruments held for trading, derivatives, equity
instruments for which the FVOCI option has not been elected and instruments whose cash flows do not meet the
SPPI requirements. Changes in the fair value of these instruments are directly recognised in the income statement.
Å FVOCI – Financial instruments measured at FVOCI are debt instruments which are held in a hold to collect and sell
business model and which meet the SPPI criteria. They are initially measured at fair value, with subsequent unrealised
changes recognised in other comprehensive income. Equity instruments for which the fair value option is elected are
also measured at FVOCI.
Reclassifications of financial assets are expected to be very infrequent and occur only when ABN AMRO changes its
business model for a certain portfolio of financial assets. No reclassifications occurred during the reporting period.
Please refer to pages 65 to 122 in the Risk, funding & capital section for our accounting policies on the measurement
of expected credit losses on financial instruments measured at amortised cost and FVOCI.
Classification and measurement of financial assets (applicable before 1 January 2018)
Before 1 January 2018, financial assets were classified, based on the criteria in IAS 39, as assets held for trading,
financial investments, or loans and receivables. Their measurement and income recognition depended on the
classification of the financial assets. The following four groups were identified:
Å Loans and receivables were non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that were not quoted in
an active market. They generally arose when money or services were directly provided to a client with no intention of trading
or selling the loan. They were initially measured at fair value (including transaction costs) and subsequently measured at
amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, with the periodic amortisation recorded in the income statement;
Å Held-to-maturity investments were non-derivative financial assets that consisted of instruments quoted on an active
market with fixed or determinable payments and a fixed maturity for which the positive intent and ability to hold to
maturity was demonstrated. They were initially measured at fair value (including transaction costs) and subsequently
measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, with the periodic amortisation recorded in the
income statement;
ABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018
Introduction Strategy and performance Risk, funding & capital Leadership Governance Annual Financial Statements Other
Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements 173
Å Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss included:
Å financial assets held for trading;
Å financial assets that ABN AMRO irrevocably designated at initial recognition to be held at fair value through profit
or loss when the instruments were held to reduce an accounting mismatch, were managed on the basis of their
fair value or included terms that had, by nature, substantive derivative characteristics;
Å Available-for-sale financial assets were those assets that were otherwise not classified as loans and receivables,
held-to-maturity investments, financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss or financial assets held
for trading. They were initially measured at fair value, with subsequent changes recognised in other comprehensive
income.
If ABN AMRO reclassified a financial asset from held for trading, the financial asset was reclassified at its fair value and
this fair value became the new amortised cost. On the same date, a new effective interest was calculated.
Classification of assets and liabilities held for trading
In both the current and prior reporting period a financial asset or financial liability is classified as held for trading if it is:
Å Acquired or incurred principally for the purpose of selling or repurchasing it in the near term;
Å Part of a portfolio of identified financial instruments that are managed together and for which there is evidence of
a recent actual pattern of short-term profit taking; or
Å A trading derivative (except for a derivative that is a designated and effective hedging instrument).
Classification and measurement of financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are initially recognised at their fair value. Under both IFRS 9 and IAS 39, financial liabilities are
classified as subsequently measured at amortised cost, except for the following instruments:
Å Financial liabilities held for trading are measured at fair value through profit or loss;
Å Financial liabilities that ABN AMRO has irrevocably designated at initial recognition as held at fair value through profit
or loss when the instruments are held to reduce an accounting mismatch are managed on the basis of their fair value
or include terms that have derivative characteristics in nature.
Under IFRS 9, the changes in fair value attributable to changes in the credit risk of financial liabilities designated at FVTPL
are presented in other comprehensive income. The cumulative amount of changes in fair value attributable to credit risk
of such liabilities is presented as liability own credit risk reserve in equity.
Financial liabilities are never reclassified after initial recognition.
Recognition and derecognition
Traded instruments are recognised on the trade date, which is defined as the date on which ABN AMRO commits to
purchase or sell the underlying instrument. If the settlement terms are non-standard, the commitment is accounted for
as a derivative between the trade and settlement dates. Loans and advances are recognised when they are acquired or
funded by ABN AMRO and derecognised when settled. Issued debt is recognised when issued, and deposits are
recognised when the cash is deposited with ABN AMRO. Other financial assets and liabilities, including derivatives,
are recognised when ABN AMRO becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the asset or liability.
Financial assets are derecognised when ABN AMRO loses control and the ability to obtain benefits from the contractual
rights that comprise that asset. This occurs when the rights are realised or expire or when substantially all risks and
rewards are transferred. Financial assets are also derecognised if the bank has neither transferred nor retained
substantially all risks and rewards of ownership, but control has passed to the transferee.
Financial assets continue to be recognised in the balance sheet, and a liability recognised for the proceeds of any related
funding transaction, unless a fully proportional share of all or specifically identified cash flows are transferred to the
lender without material delay and the lender’s claim is limited to those cash flows, and substantially all the risks, rewards
and control associated with the financial instruments have been transferred, in which case that proportion of the asset is
derecognised.
On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amount and the sum of the consideration
received and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income is recognised in
the income statement.

Annual Financial Statements
Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements
When the contractual cash flows of a financial asset are renegotiated or otherwise modified (for example in forbearance
measures), ABN AMRO analyses – in both qualitative and quantitative terms – whether the modification should be
accounted for as derecognition. Generally a 10% difference in the present value of the cash flows between the initial
and modified contract is accounted for as derecognition. Qualitative terms such as changes in the repayment schedule,
counterparty or currency could also result in derecognition. Derecognition is accounted for as an expiration of the
financial asset and recognition of a new financial asset. The difference between the former carrying amount and the
carrying amount of the new financial asset is recognised in the income statement. If the modification does not result in
derecognition, ABN AMRO recalculates the gross carrying amount of the financial asset, based on the present value of
the renegotiated or modified contractual cash flows and discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
The effect is recognised and disclosed as a modification loss in the income statement.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the liability has been settled, has expired or has been extinguished.
An exchange of an existing financial liability for a new liability with the same lender on substantially different terms,
qualitatively and quantitatively (a 10% difference in the present value of the cash flows) is accounted for as an
extinguishment of the original financial liability and recognition of a new financial liability. The difference between
the former amortised cost and the consideration paid is recognised in the income statement. Any subsequent resale
is treated as a new issuance.
Client clearing
As a general clearing member, ABN AMRO provides clearing and settlement services to its clients for, among other
things, exchange traded derivatives.
In its capacity as a clearing member, ABN AMRO guarantees the fulfilment of obligations towards central counterparty
clearing houses (CCPs) of clients’ transactions. ABN AMRO is not liable to clients for the non-performance of the CCP.
In the event of a client defaulting, ABN AMRO has the legal obligation to settle all the client’s positions with the relevant
CCPs, possibly at a loss. Possible losses arising from this guarantee might relate not only to a client’s current positions,
but also to future trades of the client. ABN AMRO receives and collects (cash) margins from clients, and remits these
margins to the relevant CCP in whole or in part. Given the stringent margin requirements set by the CCPs, possible
future outflows of resources for new clearing transactions are considered close to zero.
ABN AMRO does not reflect the exchange-traded derivatives cleared on behalf of clients in its financial statements.
Under normal circumstances, the guarantee has no fair value and is not recognised in the financial statements. The loss
recognition in the event of non-performance of a client will be in line with our contingent liabilities policy (see note 34).
Offsetting
The bank offsets financial assets and liabilities and the net amount reported in the Statement of financial position if it is
legally entitled to set off the recognised amounts and intends to settle on a net basis, or to realise the asset and settle
the liability simultaneously.
Statement of cash flows
For the purposes of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand, freely available
balances with central banks and other banks, and net balances on current accounts with other banks with less than
three months maturity from the date of acquisition. The statement of cash flows, based on the indirect method of
calculating operating cash flows, gives details of the source of cash and cash equivalents which became available during
the year and the application of these cash and cash equivalents over the course of the year. The cash flows are analysed
into cash flows from operations, including banking activities, investment activities and financing activities. Movements in
loans and advances and interbank deposits are included in the cash flow from operating activities. Investment activities
are comprised of acquisitions, sales and redemptions in respect of financial investments, as well as investments in, and
sales of, subsidiaries and associates, property and equipment. The issuing of shares and the borrowing and repayment
of long-term funds are treated as financing activities. Cash flows arising from foreign currency transactions are translated
into euros using the exchange rates at the date of the cash flows.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised in the income statement on a systematic basis over the periods that the related
expenses, for which it is intended to compensate, are recognised. In the case of an income-related grant, the grant
is deducted from the related expense.

Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements 175
Levies and other regulatory charges
ABN AMRO recognises a liability arising from levies and similar charges when it becomes legally enforceable
(i.e. when the obligating event arises).
2 Segment reporting
Accounting policy for segment reporting
The segment reporting is in accordance with IFRS 8 Operating Segments. The segments are reported in a manner
consistent with internal reporting provided to the Executive Board, which is responsible for allocating resources and
assessing performance and has been identified as the chief operating decision-maker. All transactions between
segments are eliminated as intersegment revenues and expenses in Group Functions.
During the first half of 2018, ABN AMRO transferred the portfolio of small business clients with a turnover of up to
EUR 1 million from Retail Banking to Commercial Banking. As a consequence, the segment reporting has also changed.
Historical figures have been adjusted for comparison purposes. The transfer has no effect on the historical overall group
results or financial position of the bank.
Geographical data are presented according to the management view.
Segment assets, liabilities, income and results are measured based on our accounting policies. Segment assets,
liabilities, income and results include items directly attributable to a segment, as well as those that can be allocated on
a reasonable basis. Transactions between segments are conducted at arm’s length.
Interest income is reported as net interest income because management primarily relies on net interest income as
a performance measure, not gross income and expense.
There was no revenue from transactions with a single external client or counterparty exceeding 10% of the bank’s total
revenue in 2018 or 2017.
Retail Banking
Retail Banking provides banking products and services to individuals. In addition, a wide variety of banking and insurance
products and services are provided through our branch network, online, via contact centres and through subsidiaries.
ABN AMRO HypothekenGroep, Alfam, ICS and Moneyou are part of Retail Banking.
Commercial Banking
Commercial Banking serves business clients with a turnover of up to EUR 250 million, clients active in commercial
real estate (excluding publicly listed companies, which are served by Corporate & Institutional Banking) and small
businesses. Our Asset Based Finance activities are included in Commercial Banking.
Private Banking
Private Banking provides total solutions to meet its clients’ global wealth management needs and offers a rich array of
products and services designed to address these clients’ individual requirements. Private Banking operates under the
brand name of ABN AMRO MeesPierson in the Netherlands and internationally under the name of ABN AMRO Private
Banking or various local brand names such as Banque Neuflize OBC in France and Bethmann Bank in Germany.
Corporate & Institutional Banking
Corporate & Institutional Banking (CIB) serves business clients with turnover exceeding EUR 250 million. In Northwest
Europe, clients with turnover exceeding EUR 100 million are served in eight selected sectors. CIB covers loan products
(Structured Finance and Trade & Commodity Finance), flow products (Global Markets) and specialised products (Clearing
and Private Equity). CIB’s business activities are organised according to sector, geography and product.
Group Functions
Group Functions supports the business segments and consists of Innovation & Technology, Risk Management, Legal
and Compliance, Finance, HR, Transformation and Communications, Group Audit, Strategy & Sustainability, and the
Corporate Office. The majority of Group Functions’ costs are allocated to the businesses. The results of Group Functions
include those of ALM and Treasury and the securities financing activities.

Net interest income decreased by 3% to EUR 3,122 million (2017: EUR 3,233 million). If adjusted for incidentals in the
two periods, the decrease is mainly attributable to the combined impact of approximately EUR 60 million resulting from
the updating of the model used for non-maturing deposits (NMD) and the reallocation of net interest income from Group
Functions. Interest income from residential mortgages remained stable as the lower average volumes were offset by
a slight improvement in margins resulting from good pricing discipline in a highly competitive market. Interest income on
consumer loans decreased as a result of lower average volumes and margins. Deposit income continued to be impacted
ongoing margin pressure in the low interest rate environment.
Net fee and commission income increased by EUR 27 million to EUR 365 million (2017: EUR 338 million), mainly due to
the increase in payment package fees in 2018.
Other operating income amounted to EUR 3 million (2017: EUR 116 million). The figure for 2017 included a book gain of
EUR 114 million following the sale of the remaining equity stake in Visa Inc.
Personnel expenses decreased by EUR 31 million to EUR 442 million (2017: EUR 473 million), mainly due to lower
restructuring costs in 2018 (EUR 5 million versus EUR 24 million in 2017) and declining FTE levels. This was partly offset
by the new Collective Labour Agreement, which provided for a 2% increase in salaries and a one-off payment of
EUR 1,000 per employee. The number of FTE fell by 615 to 4,445 as at 31 December 2018 as a result of digitalisation
and cost-saving programmes, and this decrease is also reflected in the further reduction in the number of branches.
General and administrative expenses increased by EUR 46 million to EUR 568 million (2017: EUR 522 million), mainly
due to a provision of EUR 30 million for additional costs to accelerate customer due diligence (CDD) remediation
programmes (see note 29 Provisions for further information) and higher regulatory levies (EUR 169 million, compared
with EUR 155 million in 2017).
Impairment charges amounted to a release of EUR 12 million, compared with a release of EUR 101 million in 2017.
Impairment charges in 2017 largely benefited from favourable model updates, as well as from additional IBNI releases
of EUR 60 million.

Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements 177
Commercial Banking
Net interest income decreased by EUR 26 million to EUR 1,602 million (2017: EUR 1,628 million). The figure for 2017
included a favourable incidental relating to a EUR 37 million release for unearned interest. Excluding this release, net
interest income rose on the back of continued growth in client lending across all sectors and improved margins. The
increase was partly offset by the combined impact of the updating of the model for NMD and the reallocation of net
interest income from Group Functions. These items’ negative impact on net interest income in 2018 amounted to
approximately EUR 40 million.
Net fee and commission income decreased by EUR 12 million to EUR 258 million (2017: EUR 270 million) as the figure
for 2017 included a one-off reclassification in the fourth quarter of that year. Excluding this reclassification, net fee and
commission income remained stable in an increasingly competitive market.
Other operating income in 2018 decreased to EUR 38 million (2017: EUR 59 million). The figure for 2017 included the
benefits of more favourable revaluation results.
Personnel expenses increased by EUR 7 million to EUR 335 million (2017: EUR 328 million). The increase was driven
by a higher restructuring provision in 2018 of EUR 31 million (2017: EUR 12 million), the one-off payment to employees
in the Collective Labour Agreement and wage inflation. These items were largely offset by the decline in the number
of FTEs that was achieved through well-executed cost-saving programmes.
General and administrative expenses increased by EUR 62 million to EUR 202 million (2017: EUR 140 million),
mainly owing to a provision of EUR 55 million for additional costs to accelerate CDD remediation programmes
(See note 29 Provisions for further information) and higher regulatory levies (EUR 48 million versus EUR 40 million
in 2017).
Intersegment expenses decreased by EUR 18 million to EUR 502 million (2017: EUR 520 million) as a result of
the continued benefits of cost-saving programmes in Group Functions. Impairment charges amounted to a charge
of EUR 253 million, compared with a release of EUR 179 million in 2017.
Impairments were elevated in 2018 due to charges recorded in specific sectors (primarily healthcare and shipping),
whereas the impairment releases in 2017 resulted mainly from model refinements for SME lending and mortgages,
as well as IBNI releases.
Private Banking
Net interest income rose by EUR 60 million to EUR 719 million (2017: EUR 659 million). Excluding the contribution of PB
Asia, net interest income rose by EUR 79 million. The increase was mainly due to margin improvements and partly offset
by the combined impact of the updating of the NMD model and the reallocation of net interest income from Group
Functions, which negatively impacted on net interest income by EUR 20 million. Net interest income in 2017 was
negatively impacted by the Euribor provision of EUR 10 million.
Net fee and commission income decreased by EUR 64 million to EUR 509 million (2017: EUR 573 million). Excluding the
contribution of PB Asia in 2017, net fee and commission decreased by EUR 49 million. Due to the volatility in the financial
markets, Private Banking clients were less active in securities transactions, while more clients opted for execution only
instead of managed portfolios, and the raised client threshold for advisory services resulted in lower advisory volumes.
Other operating income decreased by EUR 176 million to EUR 91 million (2017: EUR 267 million). Excluding the proceeds
of the PB Asia divestments in 2017, other operating income rose by EUR 58 million in 2018. This was mainly the result of
positive incidentals of EUR 60 million relating to sale proceeds and provision releases from divestments, specifically the
sale of PB Luxembourg and asset management activities in France.

Annual Financial Statements
Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements
Personnel expenses decreased by EUR 82 million to EUR 390 million (2017: EUR 472 million). Excluding the results of
PB Asia in 2017, personnel expenses decreased in 2018 owing to the substantial reduction in FTE numbers, which was
partly offset by wage inflation. The number of FTE was 445 lower than in 2017, primarily due to progress made in the
restructuring programmes and the divestment of PB Luxembourg.
General and administrative expenses amounted to EUR 248 million, compared with EUR 280 million in 2017. Excluding
the results of PB Asia in 2017, general and administrative expenses increased by EUR 6 million, mainly due to higher
regulatory levies.
Depreciation and amortisation of tangible and intangible assets amounted to EUR 21 million (2017: EUR 65 million).
The figure for 2017 included a goodwill impairment of EUR 36 million.
Intersegment expenses were EUR 10 million lower at EUR 269 million (2017: EUR 279 million) as a result of the ongoing
cost-saving programmes in Group Functions.
Impairment charges totalled EUR 3 million, compared with a release of EUR 6 million in 2017, largely driven by additions
in the Netherlands.
Corporate & Institutional Banking
Net interest income rose by EUR 191 million to EUR 1,166 million (2017: EUR 975 million) owing to the favourable
impact of new deals and on the back of increased client lending, while growth slowed throughout 2018 as a result of
the strategy refocus. Deposit income was also higher as margins improved modestly and compensated for the lower
volumes. The increase also included an amount of approximately EUR 40 million representing the combined impact of
the updating of the model used for NMD and the reallocation of net interest income from Group Functions, as well as
higher results in both Global Markets and Clearing.
Net fee and commission income decreased by EUR 11 million to EUR 527 million (2017: EUR 538 million). The decrease
was mainly in Global Markets, which is volatile by nature, and was partly offset by higher fees in Clearing as a result of
greater market volatility.
Net trading income decreased by EUR 73 million to EUR 153 million. CVA/DVA/FVA amounted to EUR 2 million negative
(2017: EUR 76 million).
Other operating income totalled EUR 268 million (2017: EUR 76 million). The increase was mainly attributable to
favourable Equity Participations results (EUR 274 million versus EUR 114 million in 2017) and more favourable
revaluations in Clearing.
Personnel expenses amounted to EUR 480 million (2017: EUR 442 million). The increase was driven by restructuring
provisions in 2018, mainly relating to the previously announced strategy refocus and, to a lesser extent, to wage inflation.
General and administrative expenses decreased by EUR 86 million to EUR 337 million (2017: EUR 423 million), mainly
due to lower provisions for project costs of SME derivatives-related issues (EUR 41 million versus EUR 139 million in
2017). In addition, regulatory expenses were higher in 2018 (EUR 86 million versus EUR 76 million in 2017).
Intersegment expenses declined by EUR 30 million to EUR 363 million (2017: EUR 393 million) as a result of the
continued benefits of cost-saving programmes in Group Functions.
Impairment charges amounted to EUR 427 million (2017: EUR 219 million). The higher impairments taken were mainly on
existing impaired loans and primarily in offshore markets (mainly in Natural Resources and Global Transportation &
Logistics) and in Trade & Commodity Finance, including diamonds.
Group Functions
Net interest income amounted to EUR 16 million negative (2017: EUR 38 million negative). The figure for 2018 included
a provision release of EUR 35 million relating to securities financing activities discontinued in 2009. If adjusted for this,
the decrease was mainly attributable to a decline in duration-related interest results, partly offset by the positive impact
of approximately EUR 80 million resulting from the updating of the model for non-maturing deposits and the reallocation
of net interest income to the business segment, and higher mortgage penalty fees.
ABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018
Introduction Strategy and performance Risk, funding & capital Leadership Governance Annual Financial Statements Other
Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements 179
Net fee and commission income increased by EUR 12 million to EUR 40 million (2017: EUR 28 million), partly due to the
increase in net fee and commission income from Stater (mortgage service provider).
Other operating income amounted to EUR 183 million (2017: EUR 228 million). The decrease was attributable to less
favourable hedge accounting-related income, including the partial sale of the public sector loan portfolio (EUR 79 million
versus EUR 181 million in 2017), and to the lower provision release for securities financing activities discontinued in
2009, and was partly offset by the revaluation of equensWorldline (EUR 69 million).
Personnel expenses decreased by EUR 82 million to EUR 794 million (2017: EUR 876 million), partly as a result of lower
restructuring provisions in 2018 (EUR 58 million versus EUR 112 million in 2017). If adjusted for restructuring provisions,
personnel expenses decreased on the back of the lower average number of FTE in 2018, partly offset by wage inflation
and the one-off payment of EUR 1,000 per employee provided for in the Collective Labour Agreement.
General and administrative expenses remained broadly stable at EUR 1,381 million (2017: EUR 1,383 million). The
benefits of ongoing cost-saving programmes were offset by higher IT investments.
Depreciation and amortisation expenses decreased by EUR 29 million to EUR 127 million (2017: EUR 156 million).
The figure for 2017 included a EUR 17 million impairment related to the ATM network. The remainder of the decrease
in 2018 was attributable to lower investments in ATMs and buildings as ongoing digitalisation means we are continuing
to reduce the number of branches.
Intersegment revenues/expenses amounted to EUR 2,143 million negative in 2018 (2017: EUR 2,228 million negative)
as a result of lower costs being allocated to the commercial business segments.

4 Net interest income
Accounting policy for net interest income
Interest income and expense on financial instruments is recognised in the income statement on an accrual basis using
the effective interest rate method, except for those financial instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss.
The effective interest rate method allocates interest, amortisation of any discount or premium or other differences,
including transaction costs and qualifying fees and commissions, over the expected lives of the assets and liabilities.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash flows to the net carrying amount
of the asset. As a result, this method requires ABN AMRO to estimate future cash flows, in some cases based on its
experience of customer behaviour, considering all contractual terms of the financial instrument, as well as the expected
lives of the assets and liabilities. Interest on loans and advances measured at fair value through profit or loss is also
included in net interest income and recognised using the contractual interest rate. There are no individual products that
are material to the bank’s results or financial position. Interest income and expenses of trading balances are included
in net trading income. Interest paid on assets with a negative interest yield is classified as interest expense. Interest
received from liabilities with a negative interest yield is classified as interest income.

Net interest income
Net interest income for 2018 amounted to EUR 6,593 million, an increase of EUR 137 million compared with
EUR 6,456 million in 2017. The main drivers were growth in corporate loans, the favourable impact of new deals (mainly
interest-related fees) and higher mortgage penalty fees. Interest income on residential mortgages remained stable as
average volumes and margins remained under control despite the increasing competition. Interest income on consumer
loans was slightly down due to lower volumes and continued margin pressure.

Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements
Interest income from financial instruments measured at fair value remained stable in 2018. This line item includes
interest from economic hedging derivatives and interest from loans and investments mandatorily held at fair value.

Total interest expense 6,052 6,045
Interest expense for 2018 amounted to EUR 6,052 million, an increase of EUR 6 million compared with
EUR 6,045 million in 2017. Interest expense from items not at fair value through profit or loss amounted to
EUR 5,899 million (2017: EUR 5,905 million).
The decrease in interest expense from due to customers, which fell by EUR 109 million to EUR 766 million
(2017: EUR 875 million), was attributable to lower interest rates for client savings. This was offset by an increase
of EUR 72 million to EUR 300 million in interest expense from securities financing transactions and an increase
of EUR 72 million to EUR 223 million in interest expense due to banks.
Other includes interest expense on hedging instruments for an amount of EUR 2,289 million (2017: EUR 2,366 million)
5 Net fee and commission income
Accounting policy for net fee and commission income
ABN AMRO applies IFRS 15 when recognising revenue from contracts with customers, all of which is included in net
fee and commission income. After identifying contracts and their performance obligations, revenue is recognised as an
amount that reflects the consideration to which the bank expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised
services to customers. The transaction price is allocated to each performance obligation. Revenue is measured at the
fair value of the consideration received, taking into account discounts and rebates. The amount of revenue recognised
is discounted to the present value of consideration due, if payment extends beyond normal credit terms.
Revenue is recognised when a promised service is transferred to the customer. Fees and commissions are recognised
either:
Å At a point in time: the fee is a reward for a service provided at a moment in time; or
Å Over time (amortised): the fee relates to services on an ongoing basis.
Net fee and commission income decreased by EUR 48 million in 2018 compared to 2017. A third of this decrease was
attributable to the PB Asia divestment in 2017 as the figure for that year included four months of fee income from this
business. The remaining decrease occurred primarily within Private Banking as net fee and commission income was
higher in 2017 due to more favourable market conditions. The decrease in 2018 was partly offset by higher fees in Retail
Banking, and specifically the increase in the fees charged for payment packages, and to higher fees in the Clearing
business as a result of greater market volatility.

6 Net trading income
Accounting policy for net trading income
In accordance with IFRS 9, trading positions are held at fair value, and net trading income includes gains and losses
arising from changes in the fair value of such financial assets and liabilities. The latter comprise trading financial assets
and liabilities, interest income and expenses related to trading financial assets and liabilities, dividends received from
trading instruments and related funding costs. Dividend income from trading instruments is recognised when
entitlement is established. Net trading income also includes changes in fair value arising from changes in counterparty
credit spreads (CVA) and changes in own credit spreads (DVA) where these impact on the value of our trading liabilities.
The funding valuation adjustment (FVA) incorporates the incremental cost of funding into the valuation of uncollateralised
and partly collateralised derivatives.

Interest instruments trading1 12 80
Equity and commodity trading1 20 61
Foreign exchange transaction results2 142 146
Total net trading income 173 287
1 Due to a refinement of transaction results in trading income prior year amounts of interest instruments trading, equity and commodity trading and other trading have been adjusted. 2 The foreign exchange transaction results have been refined, therefore foreign exchange transaction results for balances not being ‘fair value to profit or loss’ have been reported as part
of the other operating income. Comparative figures have not been adjusted.
Net trading income amounted to a gain of EUR 173 million (2017: gain of EUR 287 million) and was EUR 114 million
lower than in 2017. This was mainly caused by stable CVA/DVA/FVA reserves in 2018 as a result of relatively stable
credit spreads and interest rates during the year, whereas an amount of EUR 75 million of CVA/DVA/FVA was released
to net trading income in 2017 as a result of tightening credit spreads and geopolitical-economic events.
Income from interest instruments trading decreased by EUR 68 million compared with 2017. This item was negatively
impacted by the above-mentioned development of CVA/DVA/FVA in both 2018 and 2017 and favourably offset by the
addition to the SME provision being EUR 21 million lower in 2018.
Equity and commodity trading income decreased to EUR 20 million (2017: EUR 61 million), largely because of exposure
to energy market volatility.
Foreign exchange transaction results amounted to EUR 142 million in 2018, remaining relatively stable
(2017: EUR 146 million).

7 Other operating income
Accounting policy for other operating income
Other operating income includes all other banking activities such as leasing activities and results on the disposal of
assets. It also includes the change in fair value of derivatives used for risk management purposes that do not meet
the requirements for hedge accounting, ineffectiveness of hedging programmes, fair value changes relating to assets
and liabilities measured at fair value through profit or loss, and changes in the value of derivatives related to such
instruments. Dividend income from non-trading equity investments is recognised when entitlement is established.

Other 110 62
Total other operating income 584 745
Other operating income decreased by EUR 161 million to EUR 584 million (2017: EUR 745 million), mainly due to
a decrease in the disposal of operating activities and equity investments.
Disposal of operating activities and equity investments in 2018 includes Private Banking Luxembourg and part of
the stake in the investment funds of ABN AMRO Participaties. For 2017 this line item included PB Asia divestment.
The result from financial transactions increased by EUR 77 million to EUR 411 million in 2018 (2017: EUR 334 million),
mainly due to the increase of results from revaluation and divestments of equity securities designated at FVTPL of 
EUR 217 million and the decrease in hedge accounting-related results at Group Functions of EUR 104 million in 2018.
Result from financial transactions includes, amongst others, a total amount of EUR 448 million of fair value gains and
losses relating to instruments mandatorily measured at FVTPL, EUR 2 million of fair value gains and losses relating to
instruments designated at FVTPL, EUR 2 million of fair value gains and losses relating to FVOCI instruments, and a total
loss of EUR 41 million relating to the derecognition of financial instruments measured at amortised cost, mainly due to
the sale of a significant part of the PSL portfolio. The foreign exchange transaction results for balances not being FVTPL
amounted to EUR 19 million in 2018. These results are included in result from financial transactions as of 2018 due
to a refinement of transactions results in trading income. The comparative figures have not been restated.
Other income – Other increased by EUR 47 million to EUR 110 million in 2018 (2017: EUR 62 million), mainly as the result
of a property sale in Luxembourg.
8 Personnel expenses
Accounting policy for personnel expenses
Salaries and wages, social security charges and other salary-related costs are recognised over the period in which
the employees provide the services to which the payments relate. The accounting policies for pensions and other
post-retirement benefits are included in note 30.

Annual Financial Statements
Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements
Salaries and wages decreased by EUR 62 million to EUR 1,594 million in 2018. This was mainly due to the declining
FTE levels, reflecting the continued progress being achieved by cost-saving programmes. This decrease was partly offset
by wage inflation as the new Collective Labour Agreement resulted in salaries increasing by 2% and a one-off payment
of EUR 16 million.
Social security charges increased by EUR 16 million to EUR 243 million in 2018, mainly due to the higher social security
charges resulting from the new Collective Labour Agreement.
Other decreased by EUR 74 million to EUR 265 million in 2018, mainly due to higher additions to staff restructuring
provisions in 2017.
Personnel expenses include costs for a variable compensation plan for Identified Staff. This is not an employee
share-based payment plan as defined in IFRS 2 Share-based Payment. As a result of ABN AMRO depositary receipts
being listed on the Amsterdam stock exchange, ABN AMRO is in the process of changing the variable compensation
plan into a plan that may qualify as a share-based payment plan.
9 General and administrative expenses

Audit-related fees comprise services for regulatory reporting purposes, comfort letters and consent letters, assurance
engagements on segregation of assets, assurance on service organisation reports and procedures agreed for
supervisory purposes.
10 Income tax expense, tax assets and tax liabilities
Accounting policy for income tax expense, tax assets and tax liabilities
ABN AMRO is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Income tax expense consists of current and deferred
tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement and in the statement of other comprehensive income in the
period in which profits arise. Withholding taxes are included in income tax if these taxes are payable by a subsidiary,
associate or joint arrangement on distributions to ABN AMRO. Income tax recoverable on tax-allowable losses is
recognised as a current tax asset only to the extent that it is regarded as recoverable by offsetting against taxable
profits arising in the current or prior period. Current tax is measured using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised for qualifying temporary differences. Temporary differences represent the difference between
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes.
The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount
of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted at the balance sheet date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the
extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when there is both a legal right to offset and an intention to settle
on a net basis.

Reconciliation of the total tax charge
The effective rate based on the Consolidated income statement differs from the theoretical rate that would arise using
the statutory tax rate of the Netherlands. This difference is explained as follows:

Foreign tax rate differential 1 -40
Other -3 15
Actual income tax expense 762 979
The effective tax rate of 24.7% (2017: 26.0%) decreased from the previous year. Although the total non-deductible
expenses in respect of interest, bank levy and expenses that are partly deductible increased, this was exceeded by the
non-taxable gains and income. The changes to tax rates in various countries resulted in the carrying value of the deferred
tax assets being reduced. The adjustments of prior years reflect the effects of changes of facts or other factors in
comparison of previous periods.
Tax assets and liabilities
The most significant temporary differences arise from the revaluation of certain financial assets and liabilities, including
derivative contracts, allowances for loan impairment and investments. The following table summarises the tax position

Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will allow the deferred tax
asset to be recovered. Recognition is based on estimates of sufficient taxable income by jurisdiction in which ABN AMRO
operates and the period over which deferred tax assets are recoverable. In the event that actual results differ from these
estimates in future periods changes to the recognition of deferred tax assets could be required and these could impact
on our financial position and net profit.
Tax losses
The total accumulated losses available for carry-forward at 31 December 2018 amounted to EUR 1,413 million
(31 December 2017: EUR 1,448 million), of which EUR 55 million (31 December 2017: EUR 74 million) could be recognised
for future tax benefits. The recorded deferred tax asset for tax losses carried forward amounted to EUR 14 million
(31 December 2017: EUR 20 million).
Unrecognised tax assets
Deferred tax assets of EUR 42 million (31 December 2017: EUR 22 million) have not been recognised in respect of
gross deductible temporary differences of EUR 144 million (31 December 2017: EUR 76 million) and EUR 231 million
(31 December 2017: EUR 247 million) have not been recognised in respect of gross tax losses of EUR 1,358 million
(31 December 2017: EUR 1,374 million) because future taxable profits are not considered probable. These deferred tax
assets are mainly related to positions outside the Netherlands.
Tax credits and unrecognised tax credits
ABN AMRO does not have any carry-forward tax credits at 31 December 2018.

ABN AMRO does not recognise deferred tax in respect of ABN AMRO investments in subsidiaries, branches,
associates and interests in joint arrangements when ABN AMRO is able to control the timing of the reversal of the
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.
It is not practicable to determine the amount of income tax payable were such temporary differences to be reversed.
Of the total amount of recognised net deferred assets, EUR 37 million (31 December 2017: EUR 29 million) is related
to entities that suffered a loss either in the current or preceding year. The recognition of these deferred tax assets is
based on a projection of future taxable income.
Tax related to each component of other comprehensive income and tax related to equity can be found in the
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income and in the Consolidated statements of changes in equity.
Income tax consequences of dividend
The Executive Board proposes, subject to approval by the Supervisory Board, a final dividend of EUR 752 million
on the ordinary shares. The dividend will, in principle, be subject to 15% withholding tax.

Basic earnings per ordinary share is calculated by profit attributable to owners of the parent company divided by
the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. ABN AMRO has no instruments outstanding that could
potentially dilute the current number of ordinary shares.
The earnings per share in 2018 amounted to EUR 2.35 (2017: EUR 2.89). This is a decrease of EUR 0.54, or 19%.
A final dividend of EUR 0.80 per share is proposed for 2018 (2017: EUR 0.80). Including the interim dividend paid
on 3 September 2018 (EUR 611 million), the total dividend proposed is EUR 1.45 per share (2017: EUR 1.45).

Cash and balances at central banks increased by EUR 4.6 billion to EUR 34.4 billion at 31 December 2018, mainly due
to higher outstanding overnight positions placed at the Dutch central bank and other central banks in Europe.
13 Financial assets and liabilities held for trading
Accounting policy for financial assets and liabilities held for trading
In accordance with IFRS 9, all assets and liabilities held for trading are measured at fair value through profit or loss,
with gains and losses in the changes of the fair value taken to net trading income in the income statement.
Financial assets held for trading
The following table shows the composition of assets held for trading.
(in millions) 31 December 2018 31 December 2017
Trading securities:
Government bonds 273 1,071
Corporate debt securities 202 401
Equity securities 19 111
Total trading securities 494 1,584
Trading book loans 1 16
Total assets held for trading 495 1,600
Financial assets held for trading decreased by EUR 1.1 billion to EUR 0.5 billion at 31 December 2018
(31 December 2017: EUR 1.6 billion).
Government bonds decreased by EUR 0.8 billion, mostly related to changes in Dutch, French and Belgian bond positions.
These portfolios are mainly a result of the primary dealership in these countries and are held for the purpose of client
facilitation. Most of these contracts are hedged with short positions in corporate debt securities, government bonds
and futures.
The decrease in corporate debt securities by EUR 0.2 billion is a result of movements in various bonds and countries,
and mainly attributable to Dutch positions.
Equity securities decreased by EUR 0.1 billion, driven by a decrease in derivative contracts used for client facilitation
and in stock positions.

Financial liabilities held for trading decreased by EUR 0.8 billion to EUR 0.3 billion at 31 December 2018
(31 December 2017: EUR 1.1 billion).
The decrease resulted from lower short positions in bonds, primarily in Dutch and, to a lesser extent,
French and Belgium government bonds, and corporate debt securities.
The fair value of assets pledged as securities is shown in note 33.
14 Derivatives
Accounting policy for derivatives
Derivatives comprise derivatives held for trading and derivatives held for risk management purposes. Derivatives held
for trading are closely related to facilitating the needs of our clients. A significant part of the derivatives in the trading
portfolio is related to serving clients in their risk management to hedge, for example, currency or interest rate exposures.
ABN AMRO also offers products that are traded on the financial markets to institutional and individual clients and
governments.
Derivatives held for risk management purposes include derivatives qualifying for hedge accounting and those used
for economic hedges. A hedging instrument, for hedge accounting purposes, is a designated derivative whose fair
value or cash flows are expected to offset changes in the fair value or cash flows of a designated hedged item.
Derivative assets and liabilities subject to master netting arrangements are presented net only when they satisfy
the eligibility requirements for netting under IAS 32. ABN AMRO did not have any netted derivative positions
in the statement of financial position in either 2018 or 2017.
As derivative transactions and the related cash collateral held at a CCP are settled on a daily basis, the carrying amount
of these positions in the statement of financial position is nil.
From a risk perspective, the gross amount of trading assets must be associated with the gross amount of trading
liabilities, which are presented separately in the statement of financial position.

The notional amount of interest rate derivatives held for trading at 31 December 2018 amounted to EUR 1,093.8 billion
(31 December 2017: EUR 917.8 billion), representing an increase of EUR 176 billion. This increase was mainly due to
higher client activity of Financial Institutions as a result of clearing through central counterparties.
The notional amount of currency derivatives held for trading at 31 December 2018 amounted to EUR 92.2 billion
(31 December 2017: EUR 141.0 billion), representing a decrease of EUR 48.8 billion. This decrease was mainly
due to lower client activity caused by the increased volatility of the foreign exchange market compared with 2017.
The notional amount of interest rate derivatives held for hedge accounting at 31 December 2018 amounted to
EUR 138.2 billion (31 December 2017: EUR 151.1 billion), representing a decrease of EUR 12.9 billion. ABN AMRO
managed the interest rate risk in 2018 by unwinding approximately EUR 21 billion of interest rate swaps and entering
into EUR 9 billion of new interest rate swaps, mainly related to the increase in issued debt.
The hedging strategies are explained in greater detail in note 15.

15 Hedge accounting
Accounting policy for hedge accounting 
ABN AMRO enters into various derivative and non-derivative instrument transactions with external parties to hedge
risks on assets, liabilities, forecasted cash flows and net investments. The accounting treatment of the hedged item
and the hedging instrument depends on whether the hedge relationship qualifies for hedge accounting.
Qualifying hedges may be designated as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net investments.
A non-derivative financial asset or liability may be designated as a hedging instrument for hedge accounting purposes
only if it hedges the risk of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.
The hedged item can be an asset, liability, highly probable forecasted transaction or net investment in a foreign operation
that (a) exposes the entity to the risk of changes in fair value or future cash flows, and (b) is designated as being hedged.
The risks being hedged (the hedged risks) are typically changes in interest rates or foreign currency rates. ABN AMRO
may also enter into credit risk derivatives (sometimes referred to as credit default swaps) for managing portfolio credit
risk. However, these are not generally included in hedge accounting relationships. ABN AMRO did not use credit
derivatives in hedge accounting relationships in 2017 or 2018.
Both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, ABN AMRO assesses whether the derivatives designated
in each hedging relationship are expected to be and have been highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value
or cash flows of the hedged item (prospectively and retrospectively), using a regression analysis.
Under the Group’s policy, ABN AMRO applies the following criteria to assess whether the hedging relationship
is effective:
Å A regression co-efficient (R squared), which measures the correlation between the variables in the regression; and
Å A slope of the regression line is within a 0.80-1.25 range.
Hedge ineffectiveness and gains and losses on components of a derivative that are excluded from the assessment
of hedge effectiveness are recorded directly in result from financial transactions as part of other operating income.
ABN AMRO discontinues hedge accounting when the hedge relationship has ceased to be effective or is no longer
expected to be effective, or when the derivative or hedged item is sold or otherwise terminated.
Adoption of EU carved-out version IAS 39
Micro fair value hedges are hedging of separate hedged items, which can be assets or liabilities. For micro fair value
hedging, ABN AMRO uses the carved-out version of IAS 39, as adopted by the European Union, which means that
negative credit spreads are excluded in the hedge relationship for micro fair value hedging.
Macro fair value hedging implies that a group of financial assets is reviewed in combination and jointly designated as the
hedged item. However, the portfolio may, for risk management purposes, include assets and liabilities. In this context,
the starting difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the hedged item at the designation of the
hedging relationship is amortised over the remaining life of the hedged item. For macro fair value hedging, ABN AMRO
uses the carved-out version of IAS 39, as adopted by the European Union, which removes some of the limitations on fair
value hedges and the strict requirements on the effectiveness of those hedges. In this context, the impact of changes
in the estimates of the repricing dates is considered ineffective only if it leads to over-hedging.
Fair value hedges
ABN AMRO applies fair value hedge accounting on individual hedged items (micro fair value hedging), as well as on
a portfolio of hedged items (macro fair value hedging).
Where a derivative financial instrument hedges the exposure to changes in the fair value of the hedged item, the hedged
item is adjusted in relation to the risk being hedged. Gains or losses on re-measurement of both the hedging instrument
and the hedged item are recognised in the income statement within result from financial transactions as part of other
operating income. Hedge effectiveness for fair value hedges is measured as the amount by which the changes in the fair
value of the hedging instrument are different from the changes in the fair value of the hedged item. When a fair value
hedge of interest rate risk is terminated, any value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item is amortised
to profit or loss over the original designated hedging period, or taken directly to income if the hedged item
is derecognised.

Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements
Micro fair value hedge accounting
Hedging instruments designated in individual fair value hedge relationships principally consist of interest rate swaps,
interest rate options and cross-currency interest rate swaps that are used to protect against changes in the fair value
of fixed-rate assets and fixed-rate liabilities due to changes in market interest rates.
For qualifying fair value hedges, all changes in the fair value of the derivative and changes in the fair value of the hedged
item for the risk being hedged are recognised in the income statement.
The main sources of hedge ineffectiveness in fair value hedges are:
Å The effect of the counterparty and the Group’s own credit risk on the fair value of the interest rate swap that
is not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item, which is only attributable to the change in the interest rate;
Å The difference in discounting between the hedged item and the hedging instrument; and
Å Potential differences in maturities of the interest rate swap and the loans or notes.
There are no other sources of ineffectiveness in these hedge relationships.
Macro fair value hedge accounting
ABN AMRO manages the interest rate risk arising from fixed-rate mortgages by entering into interest rate swaps.
The exposure from this portfolio frequently changes due to new loans originated, contractual repayments and
prepayments made by customers in each period. More than one group (or portfolio) of mortgages can be identified as
the hedged item within the fixed-rate mortgage portfolio. To ensure an effective matching of hedged items and hedging
instruments, ABN AMRO applies a dynamic strategy in which hedged items are de-designated and re-designated
on a monthly basis. The hedge accounting relationship is reviewed and re-designated on a monthly basis.
As a result of the macro fair value hedge, changes in the hedged item’s fair value due to changes in the appropriate
benchmark interest rate are booked to the income statement and are offset by changes in the fair value of the hedging
derivative financial instrument. This therefore reduces the profit or loss volatility that would otherwise arise from
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps alone.
Hedged mortgages are fixed-rate mortgages with the following features:
Å denominated in local currency (euro);
Å fixed term to maturity or repricing;
Å pre-payable amortising or fixed principal amounts;
Å fixed interest payment dates;
Å no interest rate options;
Å accounted for on an amortised cost basis.
At each designation, the mortgage cash flows are allocated to monthly time buckets, based on the expected maturity
dates. ABN AMRO models the maturity dates of mortgages, taking into account the modelled prepayments applied to
the contractual cash flows and the maturity dates of the mortgage portfolio. If the swap notional exceeds the expected
mortgage notional in any given month, taking into account the uncertainty of the expected mortgage notional by applying
a haircut, mortgages that mature in adjacent buckets are designated to the swaps.
Changes in the fair value of the mortgages that are attributable to the hedged interest rate risk are recorded under
fair value adjustments from hedge accounting in order to adjust the carrying amount of the mortgages. The recognised
fair value changes in the mortgages reduce the profit or loss volatility that would otherwise arise from changes in the fair
value of the interest rate swaps.
The difference between the fair value attributable to the hedged interest rate risk and the carrying value of the hedged
mortgages at de-designation of the hedge relationship is amortised over the remaining life of the hedged item.
In addition to the above sources of ineffectiveness for micro fair value hedges, the sources of ineffectiveness specifically
for macro hedges are:
Å The difference between the expected and actual volume of prepayments for the mortgage portfolio to the extent
the difference would lead to over-hedging; and
Å The difference in payment frequency between the fixed leg of the hedging instrument and the payment frequency
of the hedged item (mortgages).

Introduction Strategy and performance Risk, funding & capital Leadership Governance Annual Financial Statements Other
Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements 201
Cash flow hedges
ABN AMRO applies macro cash flow hedge accounting by which it designates interest rate swaps as hedging
instruments and future cash flows on non-trading assets and liabilities as hedged items. The hedge accounting
relationship is reviewed on a monthly basis and the hedging instruments and hedged items are de-designated
or re-designated, if necessary, to maintain an effective hedge accounting relationship.
When a derivative financial instrument hedges the exposure to variability in the cash flows from a hedged item,
the effective part of any gain or loss on re-measurement of the hedging instrument is recognised directly in other
comprehensive income. Hedge effectiveness for cash flow hedges is measured as the amount by which the changes
in the fair value of the derivative are in excess of changes in the fair value of the expected cash flow in the cash flow
hedge. Any ineffective part of the cash flow hedge is recognised in other operating income immediately. When a cash
flow hedging instrument or hedge relationship is terminated but the hedged transaction is still expected to occur,
the cumulative gains or losses are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The cumulative gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement
when the hedged transaction affects net profit or loss and is included in the same line item as the hedged transaction.
In the exceptional case that the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gains or losses
recognised in other comprehensive income are recognised in the income statement immediately.
The main sources of hedge ineffectiveness for cash flow hedges are:
Å The effect of the counterparty and the Group’s own credit risk on the fair value of the interest rate swap that is
not reflected in the fair value of the hedged item, which is only attributable to the change in the interest rate; and
Å Potential differences in maturities of the interest rate swap and the loans or notes.
There are no other sources of ineffectiveness in these hedge relationships.
The hedged items in the macro cash flow hedge are future cash flows, which are derived from the projected balance
sheet. This projected balance sheet takes the contractual terms and conditions of financial assets and liabilities and
combines these with estimated prepayments, volume growth rates and interest scenarios.
Within the projected balance sheet, assets and liabilities are grouped on the basis of the specific interest rate index
on which they reprice (e.g. one month, three months, six months, one year). For each repricing index, all assets and
liabilities are allocated to monthly clusters in which they reprice up until their maturity.
The notional amounts of pay- or receive-floating swaps are designated to repricing all or a portion of current and
forecasted assets and liabilities, respectively, in the clusters described above. These swap transactions are designated
for hedge accounting purposes as a hedge of a gross position of a cluster of projected cash flows. In addition, the swap
will only hedge the applicable floating swap rate portion of the interest repricing and reinvestment risk of the cluster.
The availability of projected cash flows in the clusters is not constant over time and is therefore evaluated on a monthly
basis. Changes in cash flow projections may lead to a revision of the designation. Back-testing is performed on the
interest rate risk sensitivity models. Historical data is used to review the assumptions applied.
Forecasted transactions
When the hedging instrument effectively hedges a forecasted transaction or firm commitment, the changes in fair value
of the hedging instrument are recognised in other comprehensive income. Amounts deferred in other comprehensive
income are transferred to the income statement and classified as profit or loss in the periods during which the hedged
firm commitment or forecasted transaction affects the income statement. If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for
hedge accounting or is otherwise discontinued while the hedged forecasted transactions or firm commitments are still
expected to occur, hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively.
In 2018 and 2017, there were no forecasted transactions for which hedge accounting had been applied ineffectively.
Hedging of net investments in foreign operations
ABN AMRO may enter into foreign currency derivatives and currency borrowings to hedge various net investments
in foreign operations. For such hedges, currency translation differences arising on translation of the currency of these
instruments to euros are recognised directly in the currency translation reserve in other comprehensive income, insofar
as they are effective. The cumulative gains or losses recognised in other comprehensive income are transferred to the
income statement on the disposal of the foreign operation.

Annual Financial Statements
Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements
In previous years (before 2017), ABN AMRO hedged its currency exposure to certain investments in foreign operations
by hedging its net investment in these foreign operations with forward contracts. ABN AMRO currently still holds some
currency translation reserve for these respective positions, but no longer applies net investment hedge accounting.
Hedges not qualifying for hedge accounting
The fair value changes of derivative transactions used to hedge against economic risk exposures that do not qualify
for hedge accounting, or for which it is not cost-beneficial to apply hedge accounting, are recognised directly in profit
or loss.

The notional amount of the cash flow hedges decreased by EUR 9.5 billion to EUR 19.6 billion at 31 December 2018
(31 December 2017: EUR 29.1 billion). The notional amount of the macro fair value hedges decreased by EUR 11.7 billion
to EUR 18.1 billion at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: EUR 29.9 billion). The decline in the notional amount of
the swaps in the macro cash flow hedge and macro fair value hedge is a result of unwinding swaps as part of the bank’s
strategy to manage the duration and interest rate risk in line with the bank’s risk appetite. 
The micro fair value hedges increased by EUR 8.4 billion to EUR 100.5 billion at 31 December 2018
(31 December 2017: EUR 92.1 billion). The increase in issued debt and financial investments resulted in a higher
notional amount of the micro fair value hedges. The changes in market values for assets and liabilities are driven
by changes in interest rate curves observed in the market. 
The economic hedges were affected by multiple market elements as the economic hedges include hedges on interest
rate, commodity, foreign currency and equity positions.

The cash flow hedge reserve for continuing hedges decreased from EUR 176 million in 2017 to EUR 601 million negative
in 2018. The cash flow hedge reserve for discontinued hedges increased from EUR 1,402 million negative in 2017 to
EUR 850 million negative in 2018. This was mainly driven by the unwinding of swaps in the macro cash flow hedge,
which triggered a shift from continuing hedges to discontinued hedges. The overall cash flow hedge reserve was also
impacted by changes in the market values of continuing hedges and amortisations from discontinued hedges.
The carrying value of the macro fair value hedge decreased from EUR 32.1 billion in 2017 to EUR 20.2 billion in 2018,
mainly driven by hedged items and hedging instruments that matured during 2018. The fair value of hedged items in
the macro hedge portfolio decreased by approximately EUR 162 million, mainly triggered by changes in interest rates
observed in the market.
The carrying value of the financial investments in hedge relation increased by EUR 3,161 million. The impact of interest
rate movement resulted in a fair value decrease of EUR 242 million. The carrying value of the financial assets at
amortised cost in hedge relation decreased by EUR 738 million, mainly as a result of a reduction in the portfolio
of financial assets.
The total nominal value of issued debt in hedge relation increased by EUR 6.7 billion to EUR 66.0 billion. The interest
rate risk of the issued debt is hedged through the hedge relation with the interest rate risk derivatives. The fair value
of hedged items increased by EUR 289 million as a result of changes in market interest rates. The fair value movement
was offset by the unwinding of hedging activities.

Effect on financial position and performance – hedge ineffectiveness and hedging gains or losses
Hedge ineffectiveness in all hedge accounting models is driven by changes in interest rate curves. In the case of the
macro cash flow and macro fair value hedge, the ineffectiveness in 2018 was less than in 2017 owing to the decrease in
the size of the portfolios and smaller changes in interest rate curves than in 2017. On an aggregated level, the micro fair
value hedges showed a larger change in fair value and greater ineffectiveness than in 2017. In the case of the underlying
assets and liabilities, the changes in market values were less than in 2017.

The micro fair value hedge portfolio mainly comprises derivatives that hedge the interest rate risk on fixed-rate bonds
in the liquidity buffer and fixed-rate issued debt. The weighted average fixed rate in the micro fair value hedge portfolio
varies between 1.6% and 2.4%, depending on the origination date, currency, product type and original maturity.
Effect on financial position and performance – reconciliation
The macro cash flow hedges are designed to mitigate the risk of changes in interest rates. The cash flow hedge reserve
recognised in OCI (see the Consolidated statement of changes in equity) reconciles the change in the value of the
hedging instruments in the macro cash flow hedges and the amount reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to
profit or loss (see the ‘Effect on financial position and performance – hedge ineffectiveness and hedging gains or losses’
table).
The change in the value of the hedging instruments in the macro cash flow hedges during 2018 was EUR 352 million
(2017: EUR 274 million). The amount reclassified from the cash flow hedge reserve to profit or loss during 2018 was
EUR 127 million (2017: 172 million). The cash flow hedge reserve (net of tax) at 31 December 2018 was
EUR 1,144 million (31 December 2017: 945 million).
16 Financial investments
Accounting policy for financial investments
Financial investments include instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVOCI)
and instruments measured at fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL).
Accounting policy for instruments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income
Unrealised gains and losses on FVOCI assets are recognised directly in other comprehensive income, net of applicable
taxes. Interest earned, premiums, discounts and qualifying transaction costs of interest-earning FVOCI assets are
amortised to income on an effective interest rate basis. When FVOCI debt instruments are sold, collected or impaired,
the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is transferred to other operating income in the
income statement. Fair value changes in equity instruments that are irrevocably designated as FVOCI upon initial
recognition are recognised in other comprehensive income and not subsequently reclassified to the income statement,
including when such assets are sold. ABN AMRO has currently chosen not to use the FVOCI option for equity securities.
Accounting policy for financial instruments measured at fair value through profit and loss
Financial investments can be designated at FVTPL if doing so eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or
recognition inconsistency (an accounting mismatch). ABN AMRO also has financial investments that are mandatorily
measured at fair value because they do not meet the SPPI test.

Financial investments were impacted by the fact that IFRS 9 has become effective (see note 1 for more information).
At transition date, the available for sale portfolio in equity instruments was reclassed to held at fair value through profit
or loss, resulting in an increase in investments held at fair value through profit or loss. These investments increased
by EUR 1.2 billion to EUR 42.2 billion at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: EUR 41.0 billion). The increase, which
was mainly attributable to investments in US Treasury and US government bonds (EUR 4.2 billion) and driven by a rise
in the USD liquidity buffer, was partly offset by decreases in other government bonds (EUR 1.3 billion) and corporate
debt securities (EUR 1.4 billion).

Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Interest-bearing debt securities classified as FVOCI investments are assessed at each reporting date to establish
whether there are any expected credit losses. ABN AMRO has developed models to determine such credit losses.
These are explained in more detail in the Risk, funding & capital section. Impairment charges on FVOCI instruments
are recorded in (un)realised gains/(losses) fair value through OCI in the statement of comprehensive income.

17 Securities financing
Accounting policy for securities financing
Securities financing is measured at amortised cost. Securities financing consists of securities borrowing and lending and
sale and repurchase transactions. Securities borrowing and securities lending transactions are generally entered into on
a collateralised basis, with securities usually advanced or received as collateral. The transfer of the securities themselves
is not reflected in the statement of financial position unless the risks and rewards of ownership are also transferred. If
cash is advanced or received, securities borrowing and lending activities are recorded at the amount of cash advanced
(included in loans and advances) or received (due to banks or customers). The market value of the securities borrowed
or lent is monitored on a daily basis, and the collateral levels are adjusted in accordance with the underlying transactions.
Fees and interest received or paid are recognised on an effective interest rate basis and recorded as interest income or
interest expense.
Sale and repurchase transactions involve purchases (or sales) of investments with agreements to resell (or repurchase)
substantially identical investments at a certain date in the future at a fixed price. Investments purchased subject to
commitments to resell them at future dates are not recognised. The amounts paid are recognised in loans and advances
to either banks or customers and are shown as collateralised by the underlying security.
Investments sold under repurchase agreements continue to be recognised in the statement of financial position.
Proceeds from the sale of the investments are reported as liabilities to either banks or customers. The difference
between the sale and repurchase price is recognised over the period of the transaction and recorded as interest income
or interest expense, using the effective interest rate method. If borrowed securities are sold to third parties, the proceeds
from the sale and a liability for the obligation to return the collateral are recorded at fair value.

1 ABN AMRO classified all unsettled securities transactions as other assets and other liabilities, previously these were included in securities financing. Comparative figures have been adjusted.
Securities financing transactions include balances relating to reverse repurchase activities, repurchase activities and
cash collateral on securities borrowed and lent. ABN AMRO controls the credit risk associated with these activities by
monitoring counterparty credit exposure and collateral values on a daily basis and, when necessary, requiring additional
collateral to be deposited with or returned to ABN AMRO. 
The movements of securities financing assets and liabilities with banks and customers were a result of the cyclicality
of the business since clients build up their positions around the dividend season, reaching a high point primarily in the
second and third quarters, and a low point around the year-end. The pattern in 2018 was similar to that in previous years.
The decline at year-end was more significant compared to 2017 due to a decrease in repurchase agreements and reverse
repurchase agreements with several large clients.
ABN AMRO has reclassified all unsettled securities transactions as other assets and other liabilities. These were
previously included in securities financing. The comparative figures have been adjusted accordingly.
Items of securities financing transactions which ABN AMRO can repledge or resell are included in note 33 Transferred,
pledged, encumbered and restricted assets.
18 Fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value
Accounting policy for fair value of financial instruments
The fair value is defined as the price that would be received when selling an asset or paid when transferring a liability
in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.
For financial instruments that are actively traded and for which quoted market prices or market parameters are readily
available, the fair value is determined in a highly objective manner. However, when observable market prices and
parameters do not exist, management judgement is necessary to estimate fair value.
For financial instruments where no active liquid market exists, or quoted prices are unobtainable, recent market
transactions are used or the fair value is estimated using a variety of valuation techniques – including reference to similar
instruments for which market prices do exist, or to valuation models such as discounted cash flow calculation or option
pricing models (e.g. Black Scholes).
When portfolios of financial assets and liabilities are measured on the basis of the net exposure to the credit risk of a
particular counterparty, any existing arrangements that mitigate the credit risk exposure (e.g. master netting agreements
with the counterparty) are taken into account.
Unobservable inputs are estimated using a combination of management judgement, historical data, market practice and
benchmarking to other relevant observable market data. The difference between the transaction price and the internal
valuation at inception, calculated using a model, is reserved and amortised to profit or loss at appropriate points over the
life of the instrument, typically taking account of the ability to obtain reliable external data, the passage of time and the
use of offsetting transactions. Where inputs to the valuation of a new transaction cannot be reliably determined, the
transaction is initially recognised at its transaction price. Subsequent changes in fair value as calculated by the valuation
model are reported as profit or loss or in equity.
ABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018
Introduction Strategy and performance Risk, funding & capital Leadership Governance Annual Financial Statements Other
Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements 209
In order to determine a reliable fair value, where appropriate, management applies valuation adjustments to the pricing
information derived from the above sources. These adjustments reflect management’s assessment of factors that
market participants would consider in setting a price, to the extent that these factors have not already been included in
the information from the above sources. The main valuation adjustments required to arrive at a fair value are as follows:
Å Credit and debit valuation adjustments. In addition to credit valuation for loans measured at fair value through profit or
loss, credit valuation adjustments and debit valuation adjustments are incorporated into derivative valuations to reflect
the impact on fair value of counterparty credit risk and how counterparties consider ABN AMRO’s creditworthiness
respectively;
Å Funding valuation adjustment. The funding valuation adjustment incorporates the incremental cost of funding into
the valuation of uncollateralised and partially collateralised derivatives;
Å Own credit adjustment. An own credit risk adjustment is applied to financial liabilities where it is believed that
counterparties will consider ABN AMRO’s creditworthiness when pricing such instruments;
Å Model valuation adjustments for any known limitations. Management assesses the appropriateness of any model
used on an ongoing basis. To the extent that the price provided by internal models does not represent the fair value
of the instrument, for instance in highly stressed market conditions, management makes adjustments to the model
valuation to calibrate to other available pricing sources.
We believe our estimates of the fair value are adequate. However, the use of different models or assumptions could
result in changes to our reported results.
Internal controls over fair value
ABN AMRO has designated controls and processes for determining the fair value of financial instruments. A process
has been designed to ensure there are formalised review protocols for independent review and validation of fair values
separate from those businesses entering into the transactions. This includes specific controls to ensure consistent
pricing policies and procedures, incorporating disciplined price verification for both market and counterparty risk trades.
The business entering into the transaction is responsible for the initial determination and recording of the fair value of
the transaction. There are daily controls of the profit or loss recorded by trading and treasury front-office staff.
A key element of the control environment, segregated from the recording of the transaction’s valuation, is the
independent price-verification process. Valuations are first calculated by the business. Such valuations may be current
bid or offer prices in an active market, or may be derived using a model and variable model inputs. These valuations
are reviewed and, if necessary, amended by the independent price-verification process. This process involves a team,
independent of those trading the financial instruments, performing a review of valuations in the light of available pricing
evidence. Independent price verification is frequently performed by matching the business valuations with independent
data sources. For liquid instruments. the process is performed daily. The minimum frequency of review is monthly, both
for trading positions and non-trading positions. The independent price-verification control includes formalised reporting
and escalation to management of any valuation differences in breach of defined thresholds. When models are used to
value products, those models are subject to a model review process. This process requires different levels of model
documentation, testing and review, depending on the complexity of the model and the size of our exposure to the
model.
Valuation techniques
A number of methodologies are used to determine the fair value of financial instruments for which observable prices in
active markets for identical instruments are not available. Values between and beyond available data points are obtained
by interpolation and/or extrapolation. When using valuation techniques, the fair value can be significantly impacted by the
choice of valuation model and underlying assumptions made concerning factors such as the amount and timing of cash
flows, discount rates and credit risk.

Annual Financial Statements
Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements
Interest rate derivatives
This category includes interest rate swaps, cross-currency swaps, options and forward rate agreements. These products
are valued by estimating future cash flows and discounting those cash flows using appropriate interest rate curves. The
exception is interest option contracts, which are valued using market standard option pricing models. The inputs for the
discounting cash flow models are principally observable benchmark interest rates in active markets such as the interbank
rates and quoted interest rates in the swap, bond and futures markets. The inputs for credit spreads – where available –
are derived from prices of credit default swaps or other credit-based instruments, such as debt securities. In other
cases, credit spreads are obtained from pricing services. The additional inputs for the option pricing models are price
volatilities and correlations, which are obtained from broker quotations or pricing services or derived from option prices.
Because of the observability of the inputs used in the valuation models, the majority of the interest rate derivative
contracts are classified as level 2. If adjustments to interest rate curves, credit spreads, correlations or volatilities are
based on significant unobservable inputs, the contracts are classified as level 3. Exchange traded options and futures
are valued using quoted market prices and are hence classified as level 1.
Foreign exchange contracts
Foreign exchange contracts include foreign exchange forward contracts, foreign exchange options and foreign exchange
swaps. The majority of the foreign exchange contracts at ABN AMRO are traded as over-the-counter derivatives. These
instruments are valued using foreign currency exchange rates. There are observable markets both for spot and forward
contracts and for futures in the world’s major currencies. Therefore the over-the-counter foreign exchange contracts are
classified as level 2.
Government debt securities
Government debt securities consist of government bonds and bills with fixed or floating rate interest payments issued
by sovereign governments. These instruments are generally traded in active markets and prices can be derived directly
from those markets. Therefore the instruments are classified as level 1. Highly liquid bonds are valued using exchangetraded prices. Less liquid bonds are valued using observable market prices, which are sourced from broker quotes,
inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing services. For a minority of the government debt securities, active market prices
are not available. In these cases ABN AMRO uses discounted cash flow valuation techniques that incorporate observable
market data for similar government instruments. The main inputs are interest rate curves, liquidity spreads and credit
spreads. The instruments for which this method applies are classified as level 2. If adjustments to any of the main inputs
are made based on significant unobservable inputs, the instrument is classified as level 3.
Corporate debt securities
Corporate debt securities primarily consist of corporate bonds and other debt securities issued by corporate entities.
Most of these instruments are standard fixed or floating rate securities. Corporate debt securities are generally valued
using observable market prices, which are sourced from broker quotes, inter-dealer prices or other reliable pricing
services. These instruments are classified as level 1. If observable market prices are not available, ABN AMRO uses
discounted cash flow valuation techniques, based on inputs derived from comparable instruments and credit default
swap data of the issuer, to estimate credit spreads. These instruments are classified as level 2.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments that are actively traded on public stock exchanges are valued using the readily available quoted prices
and are therefore classified as level 1. Investments in private equity funds are initially recognised at their transaction
price and re-measured to the extent reliable information is available on a case-by-case basis and are classified as level 3.
Unit-linked investments
Unit-linked investments allow life insurance policyholders to invest indirectly, through a life insurance contract, in a pool
of assets. The policyholders are exposed to all the risks and rewards associated with the underlying asset pool.
The amounts due to policyholders equal the fair value of the underlying asset pool and are represented by the financial
liability. The fair values of life insurance contract liabilities are determined by reference to the fair value of the underlying
assets. Actively traded unit-linked investments are valued using publicly and daily quoted prices and hence classified as
level 1. Unit-linked investments for which there are no observable market prices are classified as level 2. Their value is
determined by adjusting quoted prices for credit and/ or liquidity risk.

Loans and advances at fair value through profit or loss
Loans and advances at fair value through profit or loss primarily consist of contracts with corporate clients of which the
contractual cash flows do not meet the SPPI requirements. The return on these contracts with embedded derivatives
is based on the price of underlying commodity contracts or loans with a floating interest rate. Discounted cash flow
models are used to value these contracts. The main inputs are interest rate curves, quoted commodity prices, liquidity
spreads and credit spreads. The instruments are classified as level 2. If adjustments to interest rate curves, liquidity
spreads and credit spreads are based on significant unobservable inputs, the instruments are classified as level 3.
Issued debt
Issued debt securities are valued using discounted cash flow models, based on current interest rate curves that
incorporate observable inputs. These instruments are classified as level 2. When there are no, or only limited, publicly
quoted prices available for these instruments and unobservable inputs have a significant effect on the fair value
calculation, these instruments are classified as level 3.
ABN AMRO refines and modifies its valuation techniques as markets and products develop and as the pricing for
individual products becomes more or less readily available. While ABN AMRO believes its valuation techniques are
appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions could
result in different estimates of the fair value at the reporting date.
Fair value hierarchy
ABN AMRO analyses financial instruments held at fair value in the three categories described below.
Level 1 financial instruments are those that are valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical
financial instruments.
Level 2 financial instruments are those valued using techniques based primarily on observable market data. Instruments
in this category are valued using quoted prices for similar instruments or identical instruments in markets that are not
considered to be active, or using valuation techniques where all the inputs that have a significant effect on the valuation
are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.
Level 3 financial instruments are those valued using a valuation technique where at least one input with a significant
effect on the instrument’s valuation is not based on observable market data. The effect of fair value adjustments on
the instrument’s valuation is included in the assessment.
ABN AMRO recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during
which the change occurred.

Level 3 sensitivity information
Government bonds – Corporate debt securities
ABN AMRO has a position in a Polish bond, denominated in euros (in note 16 Financial investments, and part of
Other OECD governments), for which the market is relatively illiquid. This bond is valued using a discounted cash flow
model. The main inputs are the interest rate curve, liquidity spread and credit spread. The valuation spread is determined
using an internal model. The sensitivity analysis is performed using a range of reasonable valuation spreads.
Other
Preferred shares are shares for which the dividend is fixed for a period of ten years, after which the dividend is
redetermined, and the shares can also be redeemed. The position is valued using a discounted cash flow model
for which the relevant inputs are the interest curve, liquidity spread and credit spread. The liquidity spread and credit
spread are unobservable inputs and are derived from similar securities. The sensitivity of the preferred shares is
determined by using a range of reasonable spreads and by considering the call option that is held by the issuer.

Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements
Equity shares – preferred shares
Equities measured at fair value through profit and loss and classified as level 3 mainly comprise private equity
investments.
Private equity shares are measured at fair value, with two calculation techniques being applied:
Å Using comparable pricing in accordance with the European Private Equity and Venture Capitalist Association (EVCA)
guidelines. This valuation technique is based on earnings multiples of comparable listed and unlisted companies.
The fair value calculation of an investment is strongly linked with movements on the public equity markets;
Å Net Asset Value (NAV) for fund investments and asset-backed investments. This is determined by using audited
and unaudited company financial statements and any other information available, publicly or otherwise. As a
consequence, the net asset value calculation of an investment is strongly linked to movements in the quarterly
performance of the company and can be used as an indicator of fair value. Net Asset Value is used as an indicator
of fair value only after a materiality assessment has been made.
New investments are initially valued at fair value and subsequently at cost for the first year of investment. Thereafter,
the fair value technique, either EVCA technique or NAV calculation, will be applied for direct investments.
The sensitivity for using comparable pricing is determined by stressing the earnings multiples in a positive and negative
market scenario, whereas sensitivity testing for the NAV calculation based upon the quarterly performance cannot be
applied.
Derivatives
Securitisation swaps linked to the RMBS transactions are valued using a discounted cash flow model, for which the
behaviour of the underlying mortgage portfolio is also relevant. The inputs used to determine fair value are the interest
rate curve and prepayment rate. The latter is the significant unobservable input that classifies these instruments as level 3.
The sensitivity analysis is performed by stressing the prepayment rate. Interest rate swaps related to RMBS transactions
are valued based on assumptions about the behaviour of the underlying mortgage portfolio and the characteristics of
the transaction. Cash flows are forecast and discounted using appropriate forward and discount curves.
A credit valuation adjustment (CVA) reflects counterparty credit risk in the fair value measurement of uncollateralised
and partially collateralised OTC derivatives. For counterparties that do not have an observable credit spread, ABN AMRO
applies a proxied credit spread extracted from counterparties of comparable credit quality that do have an observable
credit spread. ABN AMRO performs a probability of default assessment for each counterparty and allocates an
appropriate internal credit risk measure known as a Uniform Counterparty Rating (UCR). This UCR, which is significant
to the entire fair value measurement of the derivative contracts included in the following table of level 3 sensitivity
information, is internally generated and is therefore an unobservable input.

19 Loans and advances banks
Accounting policy for loans and advances from banks and customers
Loans and advances from banks and customers are held in a hold-to-collect business model. Loans and advances
where the contractual cash flows are solely payments of principal and interest (SPPI) are measured at amortised cost,
i.e. fair value at initial recognition adjusted for repayment and amortisation of coupon, fees and expenses to represent
the effective interest rate of the asset. Loans and advances that do not pass the SPPI test are measured at fair value
through profit or loss.

21 Fair value of financial instruments not carried at fair value
Accounting policy for fair value of financial instruments not carried at fair value
The categorisation and valuation of financial instruments not carried at fair value is determined in accordance with
the accounting policies set out in note 18.
Valuation methodologies
The methods and assumptions described below have been applied to estimate the fair value of financial instruments
not carried at fair value. These fair values were calculated for disclosure purposes only. Note that the fair value can be
significantly impacted by the choice of valuation model and underlying assumptions concerning factors such as the
amount and timing of cash flows, discount rates, credit risk and liquidity risk.
Short-term financial instruments
The carrying amounts (net of impairment allowances) of financial instruments maturing within a period of less than three
months or that have no contractual maturity are assumed to be a reasonable approximation of their fair value. For certain
instruments, behavioural maturities are applied.
Short-term financial instruments are classified as level 2 as unobservable inputs (such as inputs to determine credit risk,
prepayment risk and liquidity risk) do not have a significant influence in determining the fair value.
Cash and balances at central banks
Cash and balances at central banks are classified as level 1 as these instruments have a short-term nature, prices from
an active market are available and no fair value adjustments are made to the carrying amounts.
Securities financing
Securities financing includes repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending
transactions. Due to the short-term characteristics of these instruments and the value and liquidity of available collateral,
the carrying amounts (net of impairment allowances) are considered to approximate the fair value. Securities financing
amounts are classified as level 2.
Loans and advances – banks and customers
The fair value of loans and advances – banks and customers is estimated by a discounted cash flow model based on
contractual cash flows, using actual yields and discounting by risk-free interest rates. Adjustments to reflect changes
in liquidity spreads are applied and prepayment options are included in the estimated fair value. The calculations are
adjusted for credit risk by incorporating the expected credit losses over the estimated lifetime of the loan, based on
parameters including probability of default, loss given default and exposure at default. The loans and advances are
classified as level 3 on the basis that unobservable inputs significantly influence the approximated fair values. The loans
and advances for which unobservable inputs do not significantly influence the approximated fair values are classified as
level 2. Behavioural maturities instead of contractual maturities are used to determine the level classification of a small
part of the portfolio.
Cash collateral paid to counterparties in relation to Credit Support Annexes (CSA) is included in loans and advances –
banks and customers. Due to the short-term characteristics of these instruments, fair value is considered to approximate
the carrying amounts. The related amounts are classified as level 2.
Due to banks and customers
The fair value of instruments such as deposits and borrowings included in due to banks and customers is estimated by
a discounted cash flow model based on risk-free interest rates. Adjustments to reflect changes in liquidity spreads are
applied. Amounts due to banks and customers are classified as level 3 on the basis that unobservable inputs significantly
influence the approximated fair values. The financial instruments for which unobservable inputs do not significantly
influence the approximated fair values are classified as level 2. For the majority of the portfolio, behavioural maturities
are used to determine the level classification.
Cash collateral liabilities in relation to Credit Support Annexes (CSA) are included in due to banks and customers.
Due to the short-term characteristics of these instruments, fair value is considered to approximate the carrying amounts.
The related amounts are classified as level 2.

Issued debt and subordinated liabilities
The fair value of issued debt securities and subordinated liabilities is based on quoted prices. If these are not available,
the fair value is based on a market approach in which independent quotes from market participants are used for the debt
issuance spreads above the average interbank offered rates (over a range of tenors) that the market would demand
when purchasing new senior or subordinated debt from ABN AMRO. Where necessary, these quotes are interpolated,
using a curve shape derived from CDS prices.

22 ABN AMRO group structure
Accounting policy for business combinations
The Group accounts for business combinations using the acquisition method when control is transferred to the Group.
All items of consideration, including contingent consideration, transferred by ABN AMRO are measured and recognised
at fair value at the acquisition date. Transaction costs incurred by ABN AMRO in connection with the business
combination, other than those associated with the issuance of debt and equity securities, do not form part of the cost
of the business combination transaction but are expensed as incurred. The excess of the purchase consideration over
ABN AMRO’s share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired (including certain contingent liabilities) is
recorded as goodwill. ABN AMRO measures the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at the fair value
at the acquisition date.
In a step acquisition, where a business combination occurs in stages and control of the business is obtained in stages,
the identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquiree are recognised at fair value when control is obtained. A gain or loss
is recognised in profit or loss as the difference between the fair value of the previously held equity interest in the
acquiree and its carrying amount. Changes in interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a change of control are treated
as transactions between equity holders and are reported in equity.
Accounting policy for subsidiaries
ABN AMRO Group’s subsidiaries are those entities which it directly or indirectly controls. Control over an entity is
evidenced by ABN AMRO’s ability to exercise its power in order to affect the variable returns that ABN AMRO is exposed
to through its involvement in the entity. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are currently exercisable
are taken into account when assessing whether control exists.
The assessment of control is based on consideration of all facts and circumstances. The Group reassesses whether it
controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of
control (power, exposure to variability in returns, and a link between the two).
ABN AMRO sponsors entities, including certain special purpose entities, which may or may not be directly owned, for
the purpose of asset securitisation transactions and other specific and well-defined objectives. Particularly in the case of
securitisations, these entities may acquire assets from ABN AMRO companies. Some of these entities hold assets that
are not available to meet the claims of creditors of ABN AMRO or its subsidiaries. These entities are consolidated in
ABN AMRO’s financial statements when the substance of the relationship between ABN AMRO and the entity indicates
that control is held by ABN AMRO.
ABN AMRO is mainly involved in securitisations of own originated assets, such as various consumer and commercial
financial assets. This process generally necessitates a sale of these assets to a special purpose entity (SPE), which in
turn issues securities to investors. ABN AMRO’s interests in securitised assets may be retained in the form of senior or
subordinated tranches, issued guarantees, interest-only strips or other residual interests, together referred to as retained
interests. In many cases, these retained interests convey control, such that the SPE is consolidated and the securitised
assets continue to be recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position.
The financial statements of subsidiaries and special purpose entities are included in the Consolidated Annual Financial
Statements from the date on which control commences until the date on which control ceases.
Accounting policy for associates and joint ventures
Associates are those entities in which ABN AMRO has significant influence on, but no control or joint control over, the
operating and financial policies. Significant influence is generally presumed when ABN AMRO holds between 20% and
50% of the voting rights. Potential voting rights that are currently exercisable are considered in assessing whether
ABN AMRO has significant influence. Among other factors, representation on the board of directors, participation in the
policy-making process and material transactions between the entity and the investee are considered to determine
significant influence.
A joint venture is an investment in which two or more parties have contractually agreed to share control over the
investment. Joint control exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of
the parties sharing control. The activities conducted through joint ventures include cash transfers, insurance, finance
and leasing.

Annual Financial Statements
Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements
Investments in associates and joint ventures, including strategic investments, are accounted for using the equity
method. Under this method, the investment is initially recorded at cost and subsequently increased (or decreased) for
post-acquisition net income (or loss), other movements impacting on the equity of the investee and any adjustments
required for impairment. ABN AMRO’s share of the profit or loss of the investee is recognised in other operating income
in the income statement. If ABN AMRO’s share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the investment, the carrying
amount is reduced to zero, including any other unsecured receivables, and recognition of further losses is discontinued
except if ABN AMRO has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee.
Equity investments held without significant influence and which are not held for trading are measured at fair value
through profit or loss as ABN AMRO does not apply the option to measure such investments at fair value through other
comprehensive income.

Divestments in 2018
On 16 November 2018, ABN AMRO announced its plan to sell part of its stake in the investment funds of
ABN AMRO Participaties Fund III, V, VI and VII. The transaction was subsequently closed on 14 December 2018.
ABN AMRO has retained a minority interest of approximately 47% in these funds. These interests are recorded at
fair value. The portion of gain attributable to measuring the investment retained in the Capital A funds at its fair value
at the date when control was lost amounted to EUR 7 million.
On 20 February 2018, BGL BNP Paribas and ABN AMRO Bank N.V. announced an agreement concerning the acquisition
by BGL BNP Paribas of all outstanding shares in ABN AMRO Bank (Luxembourg) S.A. and its wholly owned subsidiary
ABN AMRO Life S.A. After approval by the regulatory authorities, the transaction was completed on 3 September 2018.
As part of this transaction, the activities of ABN AMRO Life S.A. were taken over by Cardif Lux Vie.

Neuflize Vie S.A. is a joint venture, where the power to govern the financial and operating policies of the economic
activity is subject to joint control.
The total amount of the investments in equity associates and joint ventures amounted to EUR 0.5 billion at
31 December 2018, representing a decrease of EUR 0.2 billion compared with 31 December 2017. This decrease
in the total carrying amount was mainly the result of the sale of part of the stake in the investment funds of
ABN AMRO Participaties in December 2018, a change in the carrying value of Nederlandse Financieringsmaatschappij
voor Ontwikkelingslanden N.V. relating to an accounting change to better reflect the economic reality, and a dividend
distribution by Nationale-Nederlanden ABN AMRO Verzekeringen Holding B.V.
Other investments in equity associates and joint ventures comprise a large number of equity associates and joint ventures
with individual carrying amounts of less than EUR 15 million.

Assets related to equity associates are mainly held by Nationale-Nederlanden ABN AMRO Verzekeringen Holding B.V.
(EUR 2.3 billion at 31 December 2018, compared with EUR 2.5 billion at 31 December 2017) and Nederlandse
Financieringsmaatschappij voor Ontwikkelingslanden N.V. (EUR 1.6 billion at 31 December 2018, compared with
EUR 1.7 billion at 31 December 2017).
Neuflize Vie holds the majority of assets under joint ventures (EUR 7.0 billion at 31 December 2018, compared with
EUR 7.5 billion at 31 December 2017).
The increase in the total profit for the period is mainly due to the results of the above-mentioned associate and joint venture.

The impairments on equity accounted investments decreased by EUR 1 million to EUR 5 million at 31 December 2018.
The increase in impaired assets related mainly to the variance in the carrying value of the primary assets of an equity
associate, compared with its fair value. The reversal of impairment allowances related to the exit of an equity accounted
investment.
Structured entities
Structured entities are entities that have been designed so that voting or similar rights are not the dominant factor in
deciding who controls the entity, such as when voting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities
are directed by means of contractual arrangements.
A structured entity has some or all of the following features or attributes:
Å restricted activities;
Å narrow and well-defined objectives;
Å insufficient equity to permit the structured entity to finance its activities without subordinated financial support;
ABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018
Introduction Strategy and performance Risk, funding & capital Leadership Governance Annual Financial Statements Other
Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements 223
Å the provision of financing – in the form of multiple, contractually linked instruments – to investors that
creates concentrations of credit or other risks;
Å relevant activities directed by contractual arrangements.
Consolidated structured entities
The total amount of notes sold to external parties amounted to EUR 0.5 billion at 31 December 2018, a decrease of
EUR 0.8 billion compared with EUR 1.3 billion at 31 December 2017. The decrease was due to the calling of several
securitisation transactions.
The securitisation transactions are primarily used for funding and liquidity purposes. There was no RWA relief
at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: no relief).
In 2018, the bank had only true sale (i.e. traditional) securitisation transactions outstanding. In such transactions,
a foundation (stichting) incorporates a bankruptcy-remote, structured entity, to which the legal title of a portfolio of
receivables is sold. As ABN AMRO continues to recognise the assets after the legal title has been sold, no derecognition
takes place. The structured entity issues notes to fund the purchase. ABN AMRO performs key ancillary roles in all its
securitisation transactions, including swap counterparty.
Risks associated with the roles in the securitisation process
Credit risk
Credit risk relates to the risk of credit losses on securitised assets. ABN AMRO retains part of the credit risk by retaining
notes and other securitisation positions such as liquidity facilities, swaps and first loss tranches. Regulatory capital is
held for all retained securitisation positions in accordance with the applicable regulation.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk relates to the risk that ABN AMRO may incur additional cash outflows. Any potential future cash outflows
relating to these positions, including collateral requirements, are taken into account within stress tests and are
integrated into the liquidity ratios, where required. This includes the potential impact of the liquidity facilities or swap
agreements that form part of certain securitisation transactions, most of which relate to transactions where ABN AMRO
is the originator of the underlying assets.
Approaches to calculating risk exposure amount
ABN AMRO does not achieve significant risk transfers for any of the mortgage securitisations. Therefore, the lookthrough approach is used and RWA reduction is not applied.
Monitoring process
ABN AMRO periodically monitors changes in credit risk relating to securitisation exposures. The significance of the
amount of credit risk transferred to third parties by securitisation of own originated assets is assessed on a monthly
basis in accordance with the regulatory significant risk transfer test. For investments in third-party securitisations, the
risk is monitored by reviewing the investor reports of these transactions. Additionally, third-party securitisation positions
are included in the firm-wide comprehensive stress tests in which the downgrade and default risks under stressed
market conditions are assessed. 
Overview of securitisation positions and securitised assets
The total amount of assets securitised in true sale securitisations decreased to EUR 21.6 billion at 31 December 2018
(31 December 2017: EUR 32.8 billion). No securitisation transactions for the purpose of capital relief were originated in 2018.

Support to consolidated structured entities
ABN AMRO did not provide support, financial or otherwise, to a consolidated structured entity, including when
ABN AMRO was not contractually obliged to do so, and nor does ABN AMRO intend to do so in the future.
Unconsolidated structured entities
Non-consolidated structured entities are entities over which ABN AMRO has no control or significant influence. ABN
AMRO is involved with structured entities through securitisation of financial assets and investments in structured
entities. Structured entities generally finance the purchase of assets by issuing debt and equity securities that are
collateralised by the assets held by the structured entities. The debt and equity securities issued by the structured
entities may include tranches with varying levels of subordination. The interest in non-consolidated structured entities
increased with EUR 1.1 billion to EUR 3.6 billion at year-end 2018 (2017: EUR 2.6 billion). The interests consist mainly of
debt securities in corporate loans of EUR 421 million (2017: EUR 4 million) and mortgage- and other asset-backed
securities recognised under financial investments of 3.2 billion (2017: EUR 2.6 billion). The maximum exposure to losses
from these interests is equal to the total carrying amount.
Sponsoring of unconsolidated structured entities.
An entity is considered a sponsor of an unconsolidated structured entity if it had a key role in establishing that entity so
that the transaction, which is the purpose of the entity, could occur. No material sponsoring occurred in 2018.

23 Property and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets
Accounting policy for property and equipment
Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment amount. At each balance
sheet date, an assessment is performed to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. Subsequent costs
are capitalised if these result in an enhancement to the asset. Depreciation is charged to the income statement on
a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of items of property and equipment, and of major components that
are accounted for separately. ABN AMRO generally uses the following useful lives in calculating depreciation:
Å Land: not depreciated;
Å Buildings: 30 years;
Å Leasehold improvements: 5 years;
Å Equipment: 5 years;
Å Installations (durable): 10 years;
Å Computer installations: 2 to 5 years.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement as a component of depreciation and amortisation expense.
Impairment losses are reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount
that would have been determined if no impairment loss had previously been recognised.
Depreciation rates and residual values are reviewed at least periodically to take into account any change in
circumstances. Capitalised leasehold improvements are depreciated in a manner that takes into account the term and
renewal conditions of the related lease.
Assets for which the bank acts as a lessor in an operational lease contract are included in property and equipment.
The asset is depreciated on a straight-line basis, over its useful life, to its estimated residual value.
Accounting policy for intangible assets
Goodwill
Goodwill is capitalised and stated at cost, being the excess of the consideration paid over the fair value of ABN AMRO’s
share of the acquired entity’s net identifiable assets at the acquisition date, less any accumulated impairment losses. For
the purpose of calculating goodwill, the fair values of acquired assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities are determined
by reference to market values or by discounting expected future cash flows to present value. Goodwill is not amortised,
but is reviewed annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that impairment may have occurred.
In the test, the carrying amount of goodwill is compared with the higher of the fair value less costs to sell and the value
in use, being the present value of the cash flows discounted at a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the risk of the
cash-generating unit to which the goodwill relates. Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement as
depreciation and amortisation expense and are irreversible.
Software and other intangible assets
The accounting policy for software and other intangible assets is determined by IAS 38 Intangible assets. Software
is amortised over a period of three years, unless the software is classified as core application software, which is
depreciated over its estimated useful life, set at a maximum of seven years. Only the development phase is capitalised
for own-developed software.
Other intangible assets include separately identifiable items arising from acquisitions of subsidiaries, such as customer
relationships, and certain purchased trademarks and similar items. In general, the estimated useful life does not exceed
ten years. Amortisation rates and residual values are reviewed at least annually to take into account any change in
circumstances.

The fair value of land and buildings held for own use was estimated at EUR 1,005 million at 31 December 2018
(2017: EUR 1,014 million). Of this fair value, 98% was based on external valuations performed in 2018, 2017 or 2016,
while 2% was based on Dutch local government property tax valuations with a discount of 0% to reflect the current
market situation. Some properties have a lower fair value than the carrying value. No impairment is recorded
because these properties are considered corporate assets. The value in use for the cash-generating units within
ABN AMRO Group is sufficient to cover the total value of all these assets.
Lessor
In its capacity as lessor, ABN AMRO leases out various assets, included in equipment, under operating leases.
Future minimum lease receipts under non-cancellable operating leases totalled EUR 702 million at 31 December 2018
(31 December 2017: EUR 593 million), of which EUR 542 million (31 December 2017: EUR 417 million) matures within
five years.

Non-current assets and/or businesses are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount is to be recovered principally
through a sale transaction planned to occur within 12 months, rather than through continuing use. Assets held for sale
(other than financial instruments) are not depreciated and are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair
value, less costs to sell. Assets and liabilities of a business held for sale are presented separately in the consolidated
statement of financial position.

The sale of ABN AMRO Bank (Luxembourg) S.A. and its wholly owned subsidiary ABN AMRO Life S.A. was finalised
in 2018 and completed on 3 September 2018. A total of EUR 3.2 billion in assets and EUR 4.8 billion in liabilities was
divested. The sale resulted in gross sale proceeds of EUR 246 million. 
Stater N.V. was reclassified in 2018 as held for sale. The reclassification of this subsidiary resulted in a movement
of assets of EUR 42 million and a movement of liabilities of EUR 41 million. 
Other movements in assets held for sale related to property held for sale. Property classified as held for sale amounted
to EUR 14 million.
25 Other assets
The following table shows the components of other assets at 31 December. 
ABN AMRO offers several products that relate to the financing of commodities. Some of these products are recognised
as loans with commodities as collateral, others as loans with embedded derivatives, and others as commodity inventory.
The classification is dependent mainly on the transfer of the commodity risk and rewards from the client to ABN AMRO.
The commodity inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value.

Total other assets 3,904 3,790
Other assets increased by EUR 0.1 billion to EUR 3.9 billion at 31 December 2018, mainly as a result of an increase in
other commodities of EUR 0.4 billion, offset by a decrease in trade and other receivables of EUR 0.4 billion.
Unsettled securities transactions are reversed repurchase agreements and securities borrowing transactions that are
delivered but not settled.
Trade and other receivables include receivables purchased by ABN AMRO (the factor) from its clients under non-recourse
factoring contracts. 
Other commodities contain a commodity inventory valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. As commodity
prices decreased during the year, ABN AMRO has valued the commodity inventory at net realisable value. This value is
based on a delivery contract with an external party. ABN AMRO had no commodity inventory in 2017. 
Other assets in 2017 and 2018 include a net receivable of EUR 0.2 billion related to the bankruptcy of DSB Bank.

26 Due to banks
Accounting policy for due to banks and due to customers
Amounts due to banks and customers are held at amortised cost. That is, at fair value upon initial recognition, adjusted
for repayment and amortisation of coupon, fees and expenses to represent the effective interest rate of the instrument.

1 The comparative figures have been restated. For additional information, refer to note 1.
Due to banks decreased by EUR 3.0 billion to EUR 13.4 billion at 31 December 2018, mainly due to a decrease in cash
collateral on securities lent and current accounts. Current accounts decreased by EUR 0.9 billion to EUR 1.7 billion at
31 December 2018, mainly due to periodic current account balances with credit institutions. Cash collateral on securities
lent decreased by EUR 2.2 billion to EUR 0.5 billion, mainly as a result of a decrease in cash collateral on securities lent
by several central banks and credit institutions. Time deposits consist mainly of funding obtained under the TLTRO II
programme. This programme has a maturity of four years, and interest payments will be settled in arrears. The interest
rate, which is fixed for the entire maturity of TLTRO II, will be set in March 2021.

1 The comparative figures have been restated. For additional information, refer to note 1.
Due to customers decreased by EUR 0.6 billion to EUR 236.1 billion at 31 December 2018, mainly as a result of
the decrease in demand deposits (EUR 2.0 billion), partly offset by an increase in current accounts (EUR 0.6 billion),
time deposits (EUR 0.6 billion) and other (EUR 0.3 billion).
Current accounts increased by EUR 0.6 billion to EUR 84.2 billion at 31 December 2018, mainly due to higher
outstanding positions held by non-financial corporations.
Demand deposits decreased by EUR 2.0 billion to EUR 124.0 billion at 31 December 2018. This was due to lower
volumes, mainly caused by the savings interest rate.
Time deposits increased by EUR 0.6 billion to EUR 27.1 billion at 31 December 2018. The main driver for this increase
was the change in client agreements from non-term to term contracts.
Other increased by EUR 0.3 billion to EUR 0.8 billion at 31 December 2018, mainly due to an increase in cash collateral
in Corporate & Institutional Banking.

28 Issued debt and subordinated liabilities
Accounting policy for issued debt and subordinated liabilities
Issued debt securities and subordinated liabilities are recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method. Hybrid or structured financial liabilities are irrevocably designated upon initial recognition to be measured at fair
value through profit or loss. The latter is applied when the instruments are held to reduce an accounting mismatch, are
managed on the basis of their fair value or include terms that qualify as an embedded derivative that cannot be separated.
ABN AMRO applies IAS 32 Financial Instruments: Presentation to determine whether funding is a financial liability or
equity. Issued financial instruments or their components are classified as financial liabilities where the substance of the
contractual arrangement results in ABN AMRO having a present obligation to deliver either cash or another financial
asset or to satisfy the obligation other than by the exchange of a fixed number of equity shares. Preference shares that
carry a non-discretionary coupon or are redeemable on a specific date or at the option of the holder are classified as
liabilities. Dividends and fees on preference shares classified as a liability are recognised as interest expense.
Issued liabilities qualify as subordinated debt if claims by the holders are subordinated to all other current and future
liabilities of ABN AMRO and its subsidiaries.
The valuation of liabilities measured at fair value includes the effect of changes in own credit spreads. The change in fair
value applies to those financial liabilities designated at fair value where own credit risk would be considered by market
participants. The cumulative amount of changes in fair value attributable to credit risk of issued debt is presented as
liability own credit risk reserve in equity. Exchange-traded own debt measured at fair value through profit or loss is
valued against market prices.
Fair value changes are calculated based on a yield curve generated from observed external pricing for funding and
quoted CDS spreads.
The following table shows the types of debt certificates issued by ABN AMRO and the amounts outstanding
at 31 December. Movements in these debt instruments involve a continual process of redemption and issuance
of long-term and short-term funding.

Annual Financial Statements
Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements
Total issued debt increased by EUR 4.2 billion to EUR 80.8 billion at 31 December 2018. This increase was mainly driven
by growth in long-term mortgages resulting in a rise in the long-term covered bond portfolio. Corporate loan growth led
to an increase in unsecured medium-term notes. The increase in long-term issued debt was partly offset by a decrease
in certificates of deposit and commercial paper within our targeted bandwidth for short-term funding.
The amounts of debt issued and redeemed during the period are shown in the condensed consolidated statement
of cash flows. Further details of the funding programmes are provided in the Risk, funding & capital section.

A loss of EUR 18 million (2017: no gain or loss) relating to derecognition is recognised in the 2018 income statement.
The change in the fair value of the structured notes attributable to changes in credit risk is determined using the credit
spread implicit in the fair value of similar bonds traded in active markets and issued by ABN AMRO.

Subordinated liabilities increased to EUR 9.8 billion at 31 December 2018, mainly due to foreign exchange
differences. No perpetual loans were recorded at the reporting date. Issued and outstanding loans qualifying
as subordinated liabilities are subordinated to all other current and future liabilities.
29 Provisions
Accounting policy for provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when ABN AMRO has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of
a past event, and it is more likely than not that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation,
and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. If the effect of time value is material, provisions are
determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market rates and, where
appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for restructuring is recognised when an obligation exists. An obligation exists when ABN AMRO has
approved a detailed plan and has raised a valid expectation in those affected by the plan by starting to implement the
plan or by announcing its main features. Future operating costs are not provided for. Provisions for insurance risks are
determined by actuarial methods, which include the use of statistics, interest rate data and settlement cost expectations.

Introduction Strategy and performance Risk, funding & capital Leadership Governance Annual Financial Statements Other
Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements 233
Provisions are established for certain guarantee contracts for which ABN AMRO is responsible to pay upon default of
payment. Expected credit loss allowances of loan commitments and financial guarantees are recognised as provisions
under IFRS 9.
The following table shows the breakdown of provisions at 31 December.
(in millions) 31 December 2018 31 December 2017

Total provisions 1,204 1,529
Insurance fund liabilities
Insurance fund liabilities include the insurance companies’ actuarial reserves, premium and claims reserves.
The expected cash outflow for 2019 is approximately EUR 2 million and approximately EUR 17 million for the 2020-2023
period. The insurance fund liabilities decreased significantly by EUR 51 million to EUR 11 million at 31 December 2018,
mainly due to the sale of ABN AMRO Life Capital Belgium N.V.
Provision for pension commitments
Provision for pension commitments includes early retirement benefits payable to non-active employees. Further details
are provided in note 30.
Restructuring
Restructuring provisions cover the costs of the restructuring plans for which implementation has been formally
announced. The decrease in the restructuring provisions was caused mainly by their use for the initiatives that are the
result of further digitalisation and process optimisation. The new restructuring provisions relate mainly to the refocusing
of the Commercial Banking and Corporate & Institutional Banking strategy, combined with initiatives resulting from
further digitalisation and process optimisation activities. Implementation of the 2018 restructuring plans will start
within one year. The estimated costs are based on the ABN AMRO Social Plan. Settlement may take up to five years.
Other staff provisions
Other staff provisions relate mainly to disability and other post-employee benefits.
Legal provisions
Legal provisions are based on best estimates available at the year-end and taking into account the opinion of legal
specialists. The timing of the outflow of cash related to these provisions is by nature uncertain, given the unpredictability
of the outcome and the time required to conclude litigation. Any provision recognised does not constitute an admission
of wrongdoing or legal liability. Legal provisions decreased by EUR 0.2 billion to EUR 0.5 billion at 31 December 2018,
mainly due to payments related to the provision for interest rate derivatives to SME clients.
Interest rate derivatives for SME clients
In 2015 ABN AMRO started a review, at the request of the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) and
the Dutch Ministry of Finance, to determine whether the bank had acted in accordance with its duty of care obligations
in respect of the sale of interest rate derivatives to SME clients. In the second quarter of 2015, ABN AMRO first
recognised a provision for compensating clients who had been disadvantaged in this respect and suffered loss or damage.

Annual Financial Statements
Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements
ABN AMRO has set up its own client reassessment process and the related checks and balances with respect to the
Uniform Recovery Framework devised by a committee of independent experts (‘the Committee’) appointed by the
Dutch Minister of Finance. On 31 December 2018, 80% of the clients received a letter containing the outcome of
the reassessment. It is envisaged that the remaining clients will receive the outcome of the reassessment in the first
quarter of 2019. At various points in the process, the reassessments will be checked by an independent external file
reviewer (in ABN AMRO’s case, by the audit firm PwC), supervised by the AFM. The total provision for SME derivativesrelated issues amounted to EUR 0.3 billion at 31 December 2018. This comprised the total amount of client compensation
(EUR 0.5 billion) and project costs (EUR 0.2 billion), after payments already made for both elements (EUR 0.5 billion).
Euribor-based mortgages
ABN AMRO has sold mortgage loans with floating, often Euribor-based, interest rates to consumers. These rates include
a margin charge. Under the applicable terms and conditions, ABN AMRO has the right to unilaterally adjust the margin
charge. ABN AMRO’s decision to increase the margin charge in 2012 resulted in two class actions, on top of multiple
individual cases, being instigated. The central question in these cases is whether ABN AMRO’s right in the terms and
condition to unilaterally adjust the margin charge is an unfair contractual clause.
After losing the class action in two instances, ABN AMRO decided to appeal at the Dutch Supreme Court. The final
documents in the appeal process were filed in late August 2018. The Procurator General of the Supreme Court is
expected to issue advice towards the end of the first quarter of 2019. The Supreme Court’s verdict is expected
approximately three months after this advice; in other words, by the end of the second quarter of 2019. ABN AMRO
has recognised a provision for this matter.
ICS redress scheme
International Card Services B.V. (ICS), the credit card business of ABN AMRO, has identified certain issues from its past
in respect of the granting of credit to consumers, as a result of which certain clients were provided with loans above
their lending capacity. This was reported to the AFM. In March 2017, ICS drafted a redress scheme setting out remedial
measures for clients who have been affected and including financial compensation for certain clients. ABN AMRO has
recognised a provision in respect of this scheme. The recovery framework has now been implemented and the final
compensation payments are expected to be made in early 2019.
Credit Commitment provisions
Credit commitment provisions increased by EUR 57 million to EUR 63 million at 31 December 2018 due to the transition
to IFRS 9. More information can be found in the transition disclosure in Accounting Policies.
Other provisions
Other provisions include provisions for tax purposes. The tax provisions are based on best estimates available at the
year-end and taking into account the opinion of tax specialists. The timing of the outflow of cash related to these
provisions is by nature uncertain, given the unpredictability of the outcome and the time involved.
Banks have a responsibility to help protect the financial services sector. We take this responsibility very seriously.
ABN AMRO invests significant resources in combating financial crime. We work closely with regulators, governments,
other banks and the police. ABN AMRO has decided, based on existing shortcomings and input from the Dutch Central
Bank, to accelerate its Customer Due Diligence (CDD) programme in order to be compliant with anti-money laundering
and terrorist financing legislation. We’ve already carried out a review of our Corporate & Institutional Banking business;
a review of our Private Banking clients is now nearly complete. ABN AMRO has developed remediation programmes
to speed up remediation actions in relation to International Card Services (ICS) and Commercial Banking and has shared
these with the Dutch Central Bank and committed to their execution. For the incremental external costs involved, we’ve
taken a provision in 2018 of EUR 85 million – for ICS and Commercial Banking. The amount is based on, among other
items, the total number of files, the time needed to review each file and the percentage that will be reviewed using
external resources. Over the past year, a number of European banks have been the object of money laundering
investigations. We recognise that, with financial crime, we have to be vigilant. We’re constantly looking for ways
to strengthen our systems and raise awareness of potential risks within the bank.

30 Pension and other post-retirement benefits
Accounting policy for pension and other post-retirement benefits
ABN AMRO sponsors a number of pension schemes in the Netherlands and abroad. These schemes are mainly defined
contribution plans. The majority of the beneficiaries of the plans are located in the Netherlands.
Defined contribution plans
For defined contribution plans, ABN AMRO pays annual contributions that have been determined by a fixed method
and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay any further contributions. Contributions are recognised directly in the
income statement in the year to which they relate. Actuarial and investment risk are for the account of the participants
in the plan.
Defined benefit plans
For defined benefit plans, the net obligation of each plan is the difference between the present value of the defined
benefit obligations and the fair value of the plan’s assets.
The actuarial assumptions used for calculating the present value of the defined benefit obligation include discount rates
based on high-quality corporate bonds, the inflation rate, future salary increases, employee contributions, mortality
assumptions and rates of employee turnover. The assumptions are based on available market data and management
expectations at the end of the reporting period.
Plan assets are measured at fair value at the balance sheet date and are netted against the defined benefit obligations.
Pension costs recognised in the income statement for defined benefit plans consist of:
Å service costs;
Å net interest costs determined by multiplying the net defined benefit liability (asset) by the discount rate, both as
at the start of the annual reporting period, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset)
during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments; and
Å curtailments or plan amendments.
Differences between pension costs and pension contributions payable are accounted for as provisions or prepayments.

Annual Financial Statements
Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements
Remeasurement
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability (asset) are actuarial gains and losses resulting from changes in
actuarial assumptions and experience adjustments (i.e. unexpectedly high or low rates of employee turnover). They are
recognised in other comprehensive income and are not recycled to profit or loss in later periods. The actual return on
plan assets is determined after deduction of costs of managing the plan assets and any tax payable by the plan itself.
Other post-retirement benefits
Some group companies provide post-retirement benefits to their retirees such as long-term service benefits and
discounts on banking products. Entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional on the employee remaining in service
up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period.
The expected costs of these benefits are accrued over the period of employment using the same accounting
methodology as used for defined benefit pension plans. These obligations are calculated annually.
Plans in all countries comply with applicable local regulations concerning investments and minimum funding levels.

Total pension and other post-retirement employee benefits expenses decreased by EUR 37 million to EUR 345 million in
2018, compared with EUR 382 million in 2017. The decrease in defined contribution plans of EUR 31 million is mainly due
to the decrease in contribution costs that resulted from the decrease in FTEs. Pension expenses for defined contribution
plans consist mainly of the cash contributions to the Dutch Collective Defined Contribution plan.
The remaining other post-employee benefits relating to defined plans consist mainly of several minor defined benefit
plans. Other post-employee benefits decreased by EUR 6 million which is due to the revised withdrawal rate of the
jubilee plan.
Dutch defined contribution plan
The Dutch defined contribution plan is a Collective Defined Contribution plan, based on an average salary plan.
The normal retirement age is set at 68 years. The contribution payable by pension fund participants is 5.5% (2017: 5.5%).
Plan participants’ contributions to the defined benefit plan in 2018 amounted to EUR 40 million (2017: EUR 43 million)
and are included in pension expenses.

Unsettled securities transactions 796 1,464

Total other liabilities 3,686 5,006
ABN AMRO has reclassified all unsettled securities transactions as other assets and other liabilities. These were
previously included in securities financing. The comparative figures have been adjusted accordingly.
Other liabilities decreased by EUR 1.3 billion to EUR 3.7 billion at 31 December 2018 (2017: EUR 5.0 billion) due to
a decrease in unsettled securities transactions and lower sundry liabilities and other payables.
The movements in unsettled securities financing transactions were a result of the cyclicality of the securities financing
activities. The decrease in sundry liabilities and other payables was partly the result of the settlement of savings from
savings mortgages with ABN AMRO Verzekeringen.

Share capital and other components of equity
Ordinary shares and depositary receipts for ordinary shares
As at 31 December 2018, all shares in the capital of ABN AMRO Group were held by two foundations: NLFI and STAK AAG.

Compound financial instruments
Components of compound financial instruments (liability and equity parts) are classified in their respective areas of the
statement of financial position.
Currency translation reserve
The currency translation reserve represents the cumulative gains and losses on the translation of the net investment in
foreign operations, net of the effect of hedging.
Available-for-sale reserve
Under IAS 39, this component includes the gains and losses, net of taxes, arising from a change in the fair value of
available-for-sale assets, excluding impairment losses recognised in the income statement and gains and losses on
hedged financial instruments. When the relevant assets are sold or otherwise disposed of, the related cumulative gain
or loss recognised in equity is recycled to the income statement.
Fair value reserve
Under IFRS 9, the fair value reserve includes the gains and losses, net of tax, resulting from a change in the fair value of
debt instruments measured at FVOCI. When the instruments are sold or otherwise disposed of, the related cumulative
gain or loss recognised in equity is recycled to the income statement.
Cash flow hedging reserve
The cash flow hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash
flow hedging instruments, net of taxes, that are recycled to the income statement if the hedged transactions have an
impact on profit or loss.
Net investment hedging reserve
The net investment hedging reserve comprises the currency translation differences arising when the currency of these
instruments are translated to euros, to the extent they are effective.
Liability own credit risk reserve
Under IFRS 9, the changes in fair value attributable to changes in the own credit risk of financial liabilities designated at
FVTPL are presented in other comprehensive income. The cumulative amount of changes in fair value attributable to
credit risk of such liabilities is presented as liability own credit risk reserve in equity.
Other reserves
Other reserves mainly comprise retained earnings and profit for the period.
Dividends
Dividends on ordinary shares and preference shares classified as equity are recognised as a distribution of equity in
the period in which they are approved by shareholders.
Capital securities
Undated, deeply subordinated, resettable, callable capital securities are classified as additional tier 1 (AT1) capital,
under total equity. ABN AMRO Bank has the European Central Bank’s permission to carry out limited repurchases
from investors and to sell back in the market.

33 Transferred, pledged, encumbered and restricted assets
Accounting policy for transferred, pledged, encumbered and restricted assets
Transferred financial assets are arrangements/transactions for which ABN AMRO has:
Å transferred the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of the financial asset to a third party, or;
Å retained the contractual rights to receive the cash flows of that financial asset, but has assumed a contractual
obligation to pay the cash flows to a third party; or
Å transferred a financial asset when the counterparty has the right to repledge or to resell the asset.
Depending on the circumstances, these transfers may either result in financial assets that are not derecognised in
their entirety or in assets that are derecognised in their entirety. More detailed information on our recognition and
derecognition policy is provided in the paragraph on significant accounting policies under note 1 Accounting policies.
Pledged assets are assets pledged as collateral for liabilities or contingent liabilities and the terms and conditions
relating to the pledge. Encumbered assets are those that are pledged or other assets which we believe to be restricted
in order to secure, credit-enhance or collateralise a transaction.
In principle, pledged assets are encumbered assets. The following differences apply to ABN AMRO:
Å Encumbered assets include mandatory reserve requirements with central banks and unit-linked investments;
Å Encumbered assets exclude assets pledged for unused credit facilities with central banks at the statement of
financial position date, i.e. mainly retained mortgage-backed securities.
Significant restrictions on assets may arise from statutory, contractual or regulatory requirements such as:
Å those that restrict the ability of the parent or its subsidiaries to transfer cash or other financial assets to or
from other entities within the Group;
ABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018
Introduction Strategy and performance Risk, funding & capital Leadership Governance Annual Financial Statements Other
Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements 241
Å guarantees or other requirements that may restrict dividends and other capital distributions being paid, or loans
and advances being made or repaid to other entities within the Group;
Å protective rights of other non-controlling interests that may restrict the ability of the Group to access and transfer
assets freely to or from other entities within the Group and to settle liabilities of the Group.
Transferred financial assets
This disclosure provides insight into the relationship between these transferred financial assets and associated
financial liabilities in order to show the risks the bank is exposed to when the assets are transferred. If transferred
financial assets continue to be recognised in the balance sheet, ABN AMRO Group is still exposed to changes in
the fair value of the assets.

Net position 35 35 71 -62 10
Securitisations
The bank uses securitisations as a source of funding, whereby the Special Purpose Entity (SPE) issues debt securities.
In a securitisation transaction utilising true sale mechanics, the bank transfers the title of the assets to SPEs. When the
cash flows are transferred to investors in the notes issued by consolidated securitisation vehicles, the assets (mainly
residential mortgage loans) are considered to be transferred.
Securities financing
Securities financing transactions are entered into on a collateralised basis for mitigating the bank’s credit risk exposure.
In repurchase agreements and securities lending transactions, ABN AMRO gets the securities returned at maturity. The
counterparty in the transactions holds the securities as collateral, but has no recourse to other assets of ABN AMRO.
ABN AMRO transfers the securities and if the counterparty has the right to resell or repledge them, the bank considers
these assets to be transferred assets.
Continuing involvement in transferred financial assets derecognised in their entirety
The bank does not have any material transferred assets that are derecognised in their entirety, but where ABN AMRO
has continuing involvement.

Pledged and encumbered assets
Pledged and encumbered assets are no longer readily available to the Group to secure funding, satisfy collateral needs
or be sold to reduce the funding requirement. The following activities conducted by ABN AMRO give rise to pledged assets:
Å cash and securities provided as collateral to secure trading and other liabilities, mainly derivatives;
Å mortgages and SME loans pledged to secure funding transactions such as covered bonds and securitisations;
Å securities lent as part of repurchase and securities lending transactions.

Total encumbered assets increased by EUR 4.8 billion to EUR 70.6 billion at 31 December 2018 compared with
31 December 2017, mainly due to an increase in residential mortgages and which was partly offset by the sale of the
activities in Luxembourg.
Off-balance sheet collateral held as security for assets
Mainly as part of professional securities transactions, ABN AMRO obtains securities on terms which permit it to
repledge or resell the securities to others. These transactions are conducted under terms that are usual and customary
in standard professional securities transactions.
ABN AMRO controls the credit risk associated with these activities by monitoring counterparty credit exposure and
collateral value on a daily basis and, when necessary, requiring additional collateral to be deposited with or returned
to the Group.

Significant restrictions on the ability to access or use the Group’s assets
The purpose of disclosing assets with significant restrictions is to provide information that enables users of the
Consolidated Annual Financial Statements to evaluate the nature and extent of any significant restrictions on the
ability to access or use assets and settle liabilities.
Restricted financial assets consist of assets pledged as collateral against an existing or contingent liability and
encumbered assets. Other restrictions impacting on the Group’s ability to use assets include:
Å Assets as a result of collateralising repurchase and borrowing agreements (31 December 2018:
EUR 12.4 billion; 31 December 2017: EUR 15.7 billion);
Å Assets held in certain jurisdictions to comply with local liquidity requirements and that are subject to restrictions
in terms of their transferability within the Group (31 December 2018: EUR 2.4 billion; 31 December 2017:
EUR 3.5 billion);
Å ABN AMRO Group N.V. is in general not subject to any significant restrictions that would prevent the transfer of
dividends and capital within the Group, except for regulated subsidiaries that are required to maintain capital in
order to comply with local regulations (31 December 2018: EUR 1.0 billion; 31 December 2017: EUR 1.4 billion).
34 Commitments and contingent liabilities
Accounting policy for off-balance sheet items
Commitments
Loan commitments that allow for draw-down of a loan within the timeframe generally established by regulation
or convention in the marketplace are not recognised as derivative financial instruments. Acceptances comprise
undertakings by ABN AMRO to pay bills of exchange drawn on clients. ABN AMRO expects most acceptances to be
settled simultaneously with the reimbursement from clients. Acceptances are not recognised in the balance sheet
and are disclosed as commitments.
Financial guarantee contracts
A financial guarantee contract requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse the holder for a loss it
incurs if a specified debtor fails to make payment when due under the original or modified terms of a debt instrument.
Initial recognition of financial guarantee contracts is at their fair value. Subsequent measurement is at the higher of the
amount of the expected credit loss and the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, the cumulative amount
of income recognised in the income statement.
Contingencies
Contingent liabilities are possible obligations whose existence will be confirmed only by uncertain future events, and
present obligations where the transfer of economic resources is uncertain or cannot be reliably measured. Contingent
liabilities are not recognised in the balance sheet but are disclosed unless the outflow of economic resources is remote.
Committed credit facilities
Commitments to provide credit take the form of approved but undrawn loans, revolving and underwriting facilities.
New loan offers have a commitment period that does not extend beyond the normal underwriting and settlement period.
Guarantees and other commitments
ABN AMRO provides financial guarantees and letters of credit to guarantee the performance of customers to third
parties. These transactions have fixed limits and generally extend for periods of up to 5 years. Expirations are not
concentrated in any particular period. ABN AMRO also provides guarantees by acting as a settlement agent in securities
borrowing and lending transactions.
Many of the contingent liabilities and commitments are expected to expire without being paid out in whole or in part.
This means that the amounts stated do not represent expected future cash flows. Additionally, guarantees and letters
of credit are supported by varying levels of collateral.
Furthermore, statements of liability within the meaning of Article 403 Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code have been issued
for a number of ABN AMRO’s affiliated companies (see also the chapter on Other information).

Total 48,583 8,455 9,990 4,432 71,460
The total of committed credit facilities, guarantees and other commitments increased by EUR 4.9 billion to EUR 76.4 billion
at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: EUR 71.5 billion). This increase was due to a rise of EUR 5.9 billion in committed
credit facilities, partly offset by a decrease of EUR 0.9 billion in guarantees and other commitments.
During the second half of 2018 ABN AMRO assessed the application of its definitions relating to committed and
uncommitted credit facilities. This resulted in a restatement of committed credit facilities at 31 December 2017.
More information on this restatement can be found in note 1. The increase in committed credit facilities by
EUR 5.9 billion to EUR 61.2 billion at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: EUR 55.3 billion) was mainly related
to an increase in credit lines granted to commercial clients, government and official institutions, partly offset by lower
credit lines granted to consumers and lower outstanding credit offers on residential mortgages.
Leasing
ABN AMRO mainly enters into leases classified as operating leases (including property rentals). The total payments
made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Lease incentives received are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the total lease expense. If it
is decided that an operating lease will be terminated or vacated before the lease period has expired, the lesser of any
penalty payments required and the remaining payments due once vacated (less sub-leasing income) is recognised as
an expense. If the lease agreement transfers substantially all the risks and rewards inherent to ownership of the asset,
the lease is recorded as a finance lease and the related asset is capitalised.
Operating lease commitments
ABN AMRO leases various offices and other premises under non-cancellable operating lease arrangements. The leases
have various terms, escalation and renewal rights. No contingent rents are payable. ABN AMRO also leases equipment
under non-cancellable lease arrangements. Total operating lease arrangements amounted to EUR 0.4 billion at
31 December 2018 (31 December 2017: EUR 0.4 billion), of which EUR 0.3 billion (31 December 2017: EUR 0.3 billion)
is due within five years.
Other contingencies
ABN AMRO is involved in a number of legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business in various jurisdictions.
In presenting consolidated financial information, management makes estimates regarding the outcome of legal,
regulatory and arbitration matters, and takes provisions to the income statement when losses with respect to such
matters are more likely than not.
ABN AMRO Group Annual Report 2018
Introduction Strategy and performance Risk, funding & capital Leadership Governance Annual Financial Statements Other
Annual Financial Statements 2018 / Notes to the Consolidated Annual Financial Statements 245
Provisions are not recognised for matters for which expected cash outflow cannot be reasonably estimated or that
are not more likely than not to lead to a cash outflow. Some of these matters may be regarded as a contingency. It is
not practicable to provide an aggregate estimate of potential liability for our legal proceedings and regulatory matters
as a class of contingent liabilities. On the basis of information currently available, and having taken counsel with legal
advisors, ABN AMRO is of the opinion that the outcome of these proceedings is unlikely to have a material adverse
effect on the consolidated financial position and the consolidated result of ABN AMRO. In particular the following
matters are regarded as contingencies.
Å Certain hedge funds initiated proceedings in Belgium and claimed the re-issue of certain Ageas Mandatory Convertible
Securities and payment of a 8.75% coupon from 7 December 2010 until 7 December 2030 (EUR 0.2 billion per annum)
or, alternatively, compensation in cash for the amount of EUR 1.75 billion from four issuers, among which ABN AMRO,
in relation to the conversion of Ageas MCS. On 23 March 2012, the Commercial Court in Brussels (Belgium) rejected
all the hedge funds’ claims. This judgement was in line with the earlier judgement in the summary proceedings
of November 2010. On 1 February 2019, the Court of Appeal in Brussels rejected all the claims of the hedge funds
(and found in favour of Ageas and ABN AMRO). The hedge funds have until 1 May 2019 to file cassation proceedings.
Å As previously reported, ABN AMRO, certain of its subsidiaries and some of their client funds had exposure to
funds that suffered losses (in some cases, significant losses) as a result of the Madoff fraud. Provision of custodial
services has resulted in a number of legal claims, including by the Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities trustee
in bankruptcy (Irving Picard) and liquidators of certain funds, who are pursuing legal action in an attempt to recover
payments made as a result of the fraud and/or to compensate their alleged losses. Certain ABN AMRO subsidiaries
are defendants in these proceedings. In view of the preliminary status of these claims, it is not possible to estimate
the total amount of ABN AMRO’s potential liability, if any. 
Å The Imtech Group was declared bankrupt in August 2015. ABN AMRO was one of the banks that extended financing
to this group and participated in the second rights offering of October 2014. By letter of 20 January 2018, Stichting
Imtechclaim and Imtech Shareholders Action Group B.V. held ING, Rabobank, Commerzbank and ABN AMRO liable
for alleged misstatements in the prospectuses and for alleged actio pauliana (fraudulent preference). By letter
of 28 March 2018 the VEB held parties including ABN AMRO liable for damage allegedly suffered by the Imtech
investors. On 10 August 2018, ABN AMRO received formal notification from Imtech’s trustees that they were
seeking to nullify a large number of transactions and claim various damages. The letter aimed to interrupt limitation
periods in view of the possible claims on Imtech’s lenders, bondholders and underwriting banks. Two execution-only
clients of ABN AMRO have commenced proceedings against ABN AMRO and are claiming an amount in excess of
EUR 600,000. Their claim is based on alleged prospectus liability, together with an alleged breach of the duty of care.
Å On 18 October 2018, Eurostar Diamond Traders N.V. (EDT) filed a civil law complaint against ABN AMRO in the
Antwerp Court, claiming a provisional amount of USD 720 million. The composition and substantiation of the amount
claimed are not totally clear, but would seem to include an unsubstantiated claim for damages of EUR 600 million on
the ground that ABN AMRO allegedly caused EDT’s demise deliberately. Damages of USD 73 million have also been
claimed for the alleged sale of unsuitable derivatives over a long period of time. Provisional liquidators of Eurostar
have since been appointed.
Å On 16 August 2016, ABN AMRO received a writ of summons from a housing corporation, Stichting Havensteder
(Havensteder), relating to two extendable loans (‘the Loans’) with a total principal of EUR 64 million. Havensteder
claimed partial annulment of the extendable part of the Loans since, according to Havensteder, the Loans conflicted
with the interest of public housing and public housing laws. Alternatively, Havensteder claimed that, as a result of
unforeseen circumstances, the interest rates on the Loans should be reduced to approximately 2.45% or 3.0%.
In the further alternative, Havensteder claimed partial annulment of the extendable part of the Loans in view of error,
breach of duty of care and breach of information duties. The court hearing in this matter took place in September 2017.
The District Court of Amsterdam is expected to announce its verdict in the first half of 2019.
Å On 22 August 2016, ABN AMRO received a writ of summons from the indirect shareholders of its former clients,
the Partner Logistics Group. The claimants alleged that the defendants, including ABN AMRO, had acted wrongfully
in relation to the bankruptcy of the Partner Logistics Group. Based on this, they claimed damages of EUR 205 million.
After all their claims were rejected on 28 October 2018, the claimants filed for appeal in late January 2019.
Å Other contingencies include EUR 56 million related to an irrevocable payment commitment (IPC) to the Single
Resolution Board (SRB) in Brussels. In April 2016, the SRB provided credit institutions with the option to fulfil part of
their obligation to pay the annual ex-ante contributions to the Single Resolution Fund (SRF) through IPCs. To secure
full and punctual payment, when called by the SRB, credit institutions needed to constitute cash collateral and fully
transfer legal ownership to the SRB.

Duty of care matters
A number of proceedings have been initiated against ABN AMRO for alleged breach of its duty of care in transparencyrelated standards. Where applicable, provisions for these matters have been made.
There can be no assurance that additional proceedings will not be brought or that amounts demanded in claims brought
to date will not rise. Current proceedings are pending and their outcome, as well as the outcome of any threatened
proceedings, is uncertain, as is the timing of reaching any finality on these legal claims and proceedings. These
uncertainties are likely to continue for some time. As a result, and although the consequences could be substantial
for ABN AMRO and have a potentially material adverse effect on ABN AMRO’s reputation, results of operations,
financial condition and prospects, it is not possible to reliably estimate or quantify ABN AMRO’s exposure at this time.
Interest rate derivatives sold to SME clients
A public debate has been ongoing in the Netherlands since 2014 on a bank’s duty of care towards SMEs with respect
to interest rate derivatives.
As explained in note 29 Provisions, ABN AMRO entered into interest rate derivatives, in combination with floating
interest rate loans, with approximately 6,800 SME clients. These clients entered into an interest rate derivative with
the purpose of fixing the interest rate risk on their floating rate loans. A combination of a floating interest rate loan
and an interest rate swap was less expensive for these clients than the alternative of a loan with a fixed interest rate.
As a result of the decline in interest rates, the interest rate swaps currently have a negative mark-to-market value. There
are no negative consequences for clients as long as the loan is not repaid, in whole or in part, before its maturity date.
Individual or class action complaints and litigation
Some SME clients needed or wanted to repay their floating interest rate loans before their maturity date. As a consequence,
the interest rate swap needed to be unwound in order to avoid creating an overhedge. In line with standard market practice
in such situations, the SME clients had to pay the bank the negative mark-to-market value of the interest rate swap. Such
payments may be compared to the penalty interest on a fixed rate loan. ABN AMRO received multiple complaints and some
clients and/or interest groups instigated legal proceedings about the bank’s alleged violation of its duty of care, claiming,
for instance, that the bank had not properly informed them of the risks associated with interest rate swaps. In most
of these cases, the client’s claim was rejected, while in some other cases the bank paid compensation to the client.
In the case of litigation relating to SME derivatives, ABN AMRO does not recognise provisions for claims that do not
meet the recognition and/or measurement criteria. There can be no assurance that additional proceedings will not be
brought or that the amount demanded in claims brought to date will not rise. Current proceedings are pending and their
outcome is uncertain. These uncertainties are likely to continue for some time.
Uniform Recovery Framework
In December 2015 the AFM concluded that some aspects of the reviews banks were conducting with respect to their
SME client files containing interest rate derivatives would need to be amended. On 1 March 2016, the AFM published
a press release and a letter addressed to the Dutch Minister of Finance, advising him to appoint a panel of independent
experts to advise on the reassessment of SME and middle-market interest rate derivatives. The draft Uniform Recovery
Framework prepared by this panel of independent experts was presented on 5 July 2016. ABN AMRO has committed
to the Uniform Recovery Framework, which was finalised on 19 December 2016. It is currently unclear how the Uniform
Recovery Framework will impact on pending and future litigation.
As this is a possible liability dependent on a future event, no provision for a possible outflow of resources has been
made and it is therefore considered a contingency. Reference is made in this respect to note 29 Provisions.

Cross-liability
A legal demerger may give rise to ‘cross-liabilities’. Under Section 2:334t of the Dutch Civil Code, the acquiring company
or companies and the demerging company, if it continues to exist, are jointly and severally liable for the obligations of
the demerging company at the time of the demerger. The acquiring companies and the continuing demerged company
will remain fully liable for indivisible obligations. In the case of divisible obligations (e.g. monetary obligations), the
acquiring company to whom the obligation transferred or, if the obligation remained where it was, the company that
continued to exist is fully liable. However, if an obligation has not been transferred to a company or if it remained with
a company, that company’s liability for divisible obligations will be limited to the value of the assets acquired or retained
in the demerger. A cross-liability is of a secondary nature. The company that did not acquire or retain the obligation is
not required to perform until the company that acquired or retained the obligation fails to perform.
On 6 February 2010, the former ABN AMRO Bank N.V. demerged into two entities: RBS N.V. and ABN AMRO Bank N.V.
(the ‘2010 Demerger’), giving rise to cross-liabilities similar to the cross-liabilities described above. If ABN AMRO Bank N.V.
fails to perform its obligations existing at the time of the 2010 Demerger, RBS N.V. is liable for the performance; if RBS N.V.
fails to perform its obligations existing at the time of the 2010 Demerger, ABN AMRO Bank N.V. is liable. RBS N.V.’s
contingent liability for divisible obligations as a result of the 2010 Demerger is limited to EUR 4.0 billion, whereas
ABN AMRO Bank N.V.’s contingent liability is limited to EUR 1.8 billion (which amount remained unchanged compared
to 31 December 2017). ABN AMRO Bank N.V. has put in place arrangements to mitigate the risks of such contingent
liability and received collateral from RBS Plc amounting to EUR 1.8 billion (2017: EUR 1.8 billion). ABN AMRO Bank N.V.
did not post any collateral with RBS N.V. or RBS Plc.
On 7 August 2008, the EC Remedy part of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. was demerged to New HBU II N.V. (the ‘2008
Demerger’), giving rise to cross-liabilities similar to the cross-liabilities as described above. If ABN AMRO Bank N.V. fails
to perform its obligations existing at the date of the 2008 Demerger, New HBU II N.V. is liable for the performance; if
New HBU II N.V. fails to perform its obligations existing at the date of the 2008 Demerger, ABN AMRO Bank N.V. is liable.
On 1 April 2010, New HBU II N.V. was transferred to Deutsche Bank AG and renamed Deutsche Bank Nederland N.V.
As a result of the cross-liabilities described above, if RBS N.V. or ABN AMRO Bank N.V. fails to perform its obligations
existing at the date of the 2008 Demerger, Deutsche Bank Nederland N.V. is liable for the performance. Deutsche Bank
Nederland N.V.’s contingent liability in this regard is limited to EUR 950 million. On 27 September 2014, pursuant to a put
option exercised by Deutsche Bank AG, the assets and liabilities of Deutsche Bank Nederland N.V., apart from the crossliabilities created as a result of the 2008 Demerger, were demerged into a newly incorporated subsidiary of Deutsche
Bank AG (the ‘2014 Demerger’). Deutsche Bank Nederland N.V. was subsequently acquired by ABN AMRO Bank N.V.
and renamed Sumsare N.V. As a consequence, Deutsche Bank Nederland N.V.’s contingent liability under the 2008
Demerger is now held by Sumsare N.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of ABN AMRO Bank N.V. Deutsche Bank AG
indemnified Sumsare N.V. for any claims (including cross-liabilities) in connection with the 2014 Demerger.
Indemnity agreement with the Dutch State 
On 1 April 2010 ABN AMRO signed an indemnity agreement with the Dutch State (currently represented by NLFI)
for a shortfall in capital above a certain amount related to specific assets and liabilities of RFS Holdings B.V. In July 2015
ABN AMRO was informed by NLFI of a claim it had received from RBS relating to these assets and liabilities in
RFS Holdings B.V. This gives NLFI the right to file a claim with ABN AMRO. As at the publication date of these Annual
Financial Statements, ABN AMRO is not aware of any claim being filed by NLFI. This situation could change in the future.

Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is still the legal owner of specific consortium shared assets and liabilities. This means
that these assets and liabilities are for the risk and reward of RBS, Santander and the Dutch State as the shareholder
of RFS Holdings B.V. On 1 April 2010, ABN AMRO signed an indemnity agreement with the Dutch State for a shortfall
in capital above a certain amount related to specific assets and liabilities of RFS Holdings.
Transactions conducted with the Dutch State are limited to normal banking transactions, taxation and other
administrative relationships. Normal banking transactions relate to loans and deposits, financial assets held for trading
and financial investments, and are entered into under the same commercial and market terms that apply to non-related
parties. 
Transactions and balances related to taxation, such as levies in the Netherlands, are excluded from the above table.
Transactions and balances related to taxation are included in note 10 Income tax expense, tax assets and tax liabilities.
Most of the tax items in this note consist of transactions and balances with the Dutch tax authorities.
The regulatory charges relating to the Dutch State are included in note 9 General and administrative expenses.
Financial assets held for trading decreased by EUR 0.3 billion to EUR 0.2 billion at 31 December 2018 compared with
31 December 2017, mainly due to lower Dutch government bonds as a result of primary dealership in the Netherlands
and client facilitation. Most of these contracts are hedged with short positions in government bonds.
Financial investments decreased by EUR 1.5 billion to EUR 4.7 billion at 31 December 2018 compared with
31 December 2017, mainly due to regular purchases and sales of highly liquid government bonds.
Derivatives related to both assets and liabilities decreased by EUR 0.4 billion at 31 December 2018 compared with
31 December 2017, mainly due to lower lending positions with the Dutch State. Derivatives transactions with Dutch
State are related to the normal course of business. 
Net interest income decreased by EUR 21 million to EUR 109 million at 31 December (31 December 2017:
EUR 130 million), mainly due to lower levels of financial investments during 2018. 
Net trading income decreased by EUR 63 million to a loss of EUR 66 million at 31 December 2018 (31 December 2017:
loss of EUR 3 million), mainly due to the sale of Dutch government bonds.

in accordance with the ABN AMRO Collective Labour Agreement (‘ABN AMRO CAO’). 4 Consistent with regular employees Other ExCo members are eligible for an employee mortgage discount. 5 In addition to remuneration, other ExCo members are eligible for benefits such as the use of a company car.
In 2018 the table for remuneration of key management personnel has been adjusted. Non base-salary related items have
been added to better reflect total compensation to key management personnel. Accordingly the 2017 amounts have

37 Post balance sheet events
On 13 February 2019, ABN AMRO announced its intention to simplify the group structure by executing a legal merger
between ABN AMRO Bank N.V. (ABN AMRO Bank) and ABN AMRO Group N.V. (ABN AMRO Group). As a result of the
proposed merger, ABN AMRO Group will cease to exist. Shareholders in ABN AMRO Group will consequently become
shareholders in ABN AMRO Bank, while shares in ABN AMRO Bank will be represented by depositary receipts, through
which the listing on Euronext Amsterdam will be retained. Holders of debt instruments will continue to hold instruments
issued by ABN AMRO Bank. The legal merger has no material effect on equity. A legal merger is subject to approval by
depositary receipt holders, shareholders and regulators, including DNB and ECB. Subject to all the necessary approvals,
including regulatory approvals, the merger is expected to be executed during 2019.
On 28 February, ABN AMRO acquired 100% of the shares in Société Générale Private Banking NV in Belgium. Within
this transaction approximately EUR 1.2 billion assets and EUR 1.1 billion liabilities are acquired. This subsidiary will be
included in the Private Banking segment. By combining ABN AMRO’s existing private banking activities in Belgium with
those of Société Générale, ABN AMRO strengthens its market position in Belgium and its position in the Eurozone as a
leading private bank. As of the date of these financial statements, ABN AMRO expects an amount of approximately
EUR 40 million to be recorded as client relationship intangible asset and goodwill, which is subject to the finalisation of
the purchase price allocation. Total client assets will increase by approximately EUR 6 billion as result of this acquisition.
In the first quarter of 2019, ABN AMRO completed the sale of part of its public sector loan portfolio to NWB Bank
for a total notional amount of EUR 0.6 billion.

Basis for our opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Dutch law,
including the Dutch Standards on Auditing.
Our responsibilities under those standards are further
described in the “Our responsibilities for the audit of
the financial statements” section of our report.
We are independent of ABN AMRO Group N.V.
in accordance with the EU Regulation on specific
requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest
entities, the Wet toezicht accountantsorganisaties
(Wta, Audit firms supervision act), the Verordening inzake
de onafhankelijkheid van accountants bij assuranceopdrachten (ViO, Code of Ethics for Professional
Accountants, a regulation with respect to independence)
and other relevant independence regulations in the
Netherlands. Furthermore we have complied with the
Verordening gedrags- en beroepsregels accountants
(VGBA, Dutch Code of Ethics).
We believe the audit evidence we have obtained is
sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.

Materiality
Materiality EUR 150 million (2017: EUR 150 million)
Benchmark applied 5% of operating profit before taxation
Explanation A benchmark of 5% of operating profit before taxation is, based on our professional judgment, an appropriate
quantitative indicator of materiality and it best reflects the financial performance of ABN AMRO Group N.V. In our
planning phase we have set the initial planning materiality at EUR 150 million. We reassessed the materiality based on
the 2018 operating profit before taxation and concluded the initial planning materiality to be appropriate for the purpose
of the audit of the 2018 annual financial statements.
We have also taken into account misstatements and/or
possible misstatements that in our opinion are material for
the users of the financial statements for qualitative
reasons.
We agreed with the supervisory board that misstatements
in excess of EUR 7.5 million, which are identified during
the audit, would be reported to them, as well as smaller
misstatements that in our view must be reported on
qualitative grounds.
Scope of the group audit
ABN AMRO Group N.V. is at the head of a group of entities.
The financial information of this group is included in the
consolidated financial statements of ABN AMRO Group N.V.
Our group audit mainly focused on significant group entities
in France, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States
based on size and risk. We have performed full scope audit
procedures, specific scope audit procedures or review
scope audit procedures at those entities. We were
responsible for the scope and direction of the audit
procedures and issued group instructions to all
components teams in scope. On a regular basis, we
interacted with the component teams during the various
stages of the audit. Based on our risk assessment, we
visited component locations in France, Germany and the
United States. We reviewed local working papers and
conclusions and met with local management.
In total, the procedures above for entities in scope
cover approximately 91% of the group’s total assets and
approximately 93% of operating profit before taxation,
of which 87% respectively 82% for full scope entities.
For the remaining components we performed, amongst
other procedures, analytical procedures to corroborate our
assessment that there were no significant risks of material
misstatements within these components. All entities in
scope for group reporting are audited by EY.
By performing the procedures mentioned above at group
entities, together with additional procedures at group level,
we have been able to obtain sufficient and appropriate audit
evidence about the group’s financial information to provide
an opinion about the consolidated financial statements.
Our key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our
professional judgment, were of most significance in our
audit of the financial statements. We have communicated
the key audit matters to the supervisory board. The key
audit matters are not a comprehensive reflection of all
matters discussed.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit
of the financial statements as a whole and in forming our
opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion
on these matters.

Estimation uncertainty with respect to impairment allowances for loans and receivables – customers
Risk ABN AMRO adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments (hereafter: IFRS 9) as at 1 January 2018 and has applied the principles of IFRS 9
retrospectively from 1 January 2018 onwards. The total net impact on equity as at 1 January 2018 amounts to EUR 319 million lower
carrying value, of which EUR 166 million relates to classification and measurement and EUR 153 million relates to impairments.
At 31 December 2018, the impairment allowance for loans and advances customers amounts to EUR 2.3 billion. Impairment allowances
represent the bank’s best estimate of expected credit losses on the loans and advances customers at balance sheet date. They are
calculated based on the risk of default over different time horizons, depending on whether the credit risk of the borrower has increased
significantly since the exposure was first recognized. The loss allowance for those exposures that have not increased significantly in
credit risk (“stage 1” exposures) is based on 12-month expected credit losses (ECLs). The allowance for those exposures that have
suffered a significant increase in credit risk (“stage 2” and “stage 3” exposures) is based on lifetime ECLs. The ECL of stage 1 loan
portfolios, stage 2 loan portfolios and stage 3 loan portfolios of a similar nature and below a certain threshold are calculated collectively.
The remaining stage 3 loan portfolios are calculated individually.
ECL calculations are probability-weighted estimates of the present value of cash shortfalls using models, applying scenarios, and which
approximate the impact of historical losses on the one hand and forward-looking developments on the other hand. There is a large
increase in data inputs required for these models that have not been used previously for the preparation of accounting records, which
increases the risk of data inaccuracy and data incompleteness. The inputs to these models are amongst others based on historical loss
experience, macroeconomic variables, credit conditions of the loan and cash flow projections with judgment applied to determine the
assumptions used to calculate the loan impairment allowance. Proxies and overlays are applied where data driven parameters or
calculations are not considered representative of the risk or conditions of the portfolio.
The bank’s assessment of significant increase in credit risk, correct stage classification and the determination of the loan impairment
allowance is part of the risk estimation process, and requires significant management judgment. As the loans and advances customers
and the associated loan impairment allowance are material to the bank’s balance sheet and income statement and given the related
estimation uncertainty on loan impairment allowances, we consider this a key audit matter.
The critical accounting estimates and judgments and loan impairment allowance amounts are disclosed in note 1 Accounting policies
and note 20 Loans and advances customers to the annual financial statements. Related accounting policies and credit risk disclosures
are included in the Risk, Funding and Capital section of the executive board report.
Our audit
approach
As ABN AMRO adopted IFRS 9 Financial Instruments as at 1 January 2018, we performed audit procedures on the opening balances to
gain assurance on the transition from IAS 39. This included evaluating the accounting interpretations for compliance with IFRS 9 and
testing the adjustments and disclosures made on the transition.
For the year-end loan impairment allowance, we have obtained an understanding of the loan origination process, the credit risk
management process and the estimation process of determining impairment allowances for loans and advances customers, and tested
the operating effectiveness of controls within these processes. Furthermore, we performed substantive and analytical procedures over
data, models, impairment calculation and overlays.
For collectively assessed loan impairment allowances, using models, we involved our modelling specialists to assess the modelling
methodology, challenge the underlying assumptions and to independently reperform the calculation for material portfolios. The
appropriateness of the bank’s judgments was also assessed in respect of inputs and judgmental overlays. For macroeconomic variables,
we compared data and assumptions used to external benchmarks, with the support of our internal specialists. To verify data quality,
we tested the data used in the calculation by reconciling to source systems.
On a risk basis, we selected individual loans and performed detailed credit file reviews and assessed whether the bank correctly applied
its credit risk policy.
In addition, we challenged the bank’s criteria used to allocate an asset to stage 1, 2 or 3 in accordance with IFRS 9, tested assets in stage
1, 2 and 3 to verify that they were allocated to the appropriate stage, assessed the scenarios applied and recalculated the impairment
amounts recorded. For certain areas, assisted by our specialists, we assessed the assumptions, such as estimated future cash flows and
collateral valuations, underlying the loan impairment calculation. Calculations based on a discounted cash flow model within our sample
were re-performed.
Finally, we assessed whether the disclosures are in compliance with EU-IFRS requirements.
Key
observations
Based on our procedures performed we consider the impairment allowance for loans and advances customers to be reasonable.
The IFRS 9 transitional disclosure and the disclosures on loans and advances customers and loan impairment allowance are considered
adequate and appropriate and meet the requirements under EU-IFRS.

Other / Independent auditor’s report 261
Estimation uncertainty with respect to provisions for conduct, regulatory matters and restructuring
Risk At 31 December 2018, the total provisions amount to EUR 1.2 billion of which an amount of EUR 475 million relates to legal provisions
covering conduct and regulatory matters. An amount of EUR 294 million is provided for restructuring.
The continued increased regulatory scrutiny gives rise to a high level of judgment in determining appropriate provisions and disclosures.
ABN AMRO has to comply with applicable laws and regulations, including those in relation to client acceptance and payment transactions.
Included in the legal provisions are amongst others the provision for SME derivatives related issues amounting to EUR 275 million. As part
of the other provisions of EUR 178 million, an amount of EUR 85 million is provided for in relation to the Know Your Client (KYC) and
transaction monitoring remediation programs.
The restructuring provision is recorded for programs that are planned and controlled by the bank due to material changes in the scope
of certain business segments or the manner in which that business is conducted.
These provisions are liabilities of uncertain timing or amount and require considerable judgment of the bank. Due to this high level
of judgment and the significant amounts involved, we consider this a key audit matter.
The critical accounting estimates and judgments and provision amounts are disclosed in note 1 Accounting policies and note 29 Provisions.
Our audit
approach
For the provisions recognized we assessed whether these provisions are reasonable and meet the bank’s accounting policies and other
legal and regulatory requirements. We challenged the underlying assumptions and tested the data used.
We have obtained an understanding of the entity level controls and the legal and regulatory framework of the bank. On a regular basis,
we inquired with the Legal department and Compliance department of the bank to understand and discuss existing and potentially new
constructive and legal obligations, and regulatory matters.
We examined the relevant regulatory and legal correspondence to assess developments in regulatory findings and observations.
We periodically met with the executive board members to understand the significant and potential obligations and challenged their views
based on our audit procedures performed, knowledge of the bank and changes in the regulatory environment. We read the minutes of the
executive board and supervisory board and attended the risk and capital committee meetings throughout the year. In addition, we held
regular bilateral meetings with the chairs of the supervisory board, audit committee and risk and capital committee. Furthermore, we
obtained legal letters from external lawyers to understand regulatory and legal matters.
In line with auditing standard 250, we performed an analysis of the shortcomings as identified by the Dutch Central Bank in the KYC
process and transaction monitoring process and the remediation thereon. We examined the level of provisioning, performed test of details
and assessed the assumptions and judgments made by the bank. Especially in the area of being compliant to the Anti-Money Laundering
and Counter Terrorism Financing Act, we involved our internal specialists. Possible outcomes were considered by us for material
provisions to independently assess the reasonableness of the judgment applied by the bank.
Finally, we assessed the completeness and accuracy of the disclosures related to provisions and whether these disclosures are in
compliance with EU-IFRS requirements.
Key
observations
Based on our procedures performed we consider the provisions to be reasonable.
The disclosure on provisions is considered adequate and appropriate and meets the requirements under EU-IFRS.
Reliability and continuity of electronic data processing
Risk The bank is highly dependent on the reliability and the continuity of electronic data processing due to the significant number of transactions
that are processed daily. External reporting and the increased granularity of financial and non-financial data are also important to
stakeholders. An adequate IT infrastructure ensures the reliability and continuity of the bank’s business processes and financial reporting.
The bank continuously makes investments to further improve the IT environment and IT systems. The audit approach relies on automated
controls and therefore on the effectiveness of controls over IT systems. We identified and reported that access management controls for
certain applications in the financial reporting process requires improvement. The bank implemented several remediation activities to
reduce the risk over access management in the financial reporting process. As the reliability and continuity of the IT systems may have an
impact on automated data processing, and due to the pervasive nature of IT general controls, we consider this a key audit matter.
A summary of technology and the IT environment is included in the Non-financial review section in the executive board report.
Our audit
approach
IT general controls related to access management and change management and application controls were tested over automated data
processing systems, operating systems and data bases, where we relied upon for financial reporting.
In some areas we performed additional procedures on access management for the related systems.
We also assessed the reliability and continuity of the IT environment and the possible impact of changes during the year either from
ongoing internal restructuring initiatives or to meet external reporting requirements. In addition, our audit procedures consisted of
assessing the developments in the IT infrastructure and analyzing the impact on the IT organization. We assessed the reliability and
continuity of automated data processing only to the extent necessary within the scope of the audit of the annual financial statements.
Key
observations
For the audit of the annual financial statements we found the reliability and continuity of the automated data processing
systems adequate.

Other / Independent auditor’s report
In the 2017 auditor’s report, “suspense accounts” was
identified as key audit matter. We considered the impact
lower compared to prior year, as such, we have no longer
included this item as a key audit matter.
Report on other information included
in the annual report
In addition to the financial statements and our auditor’s
report thereon, the annual report contains other
information that consists of:
Å The executive board report
Å The report of the supervisory board
Å Other information as required by Part 9 of Book 2
of the Dutch Civil Code
Based on the following procedures performed,
we conclude that the other information:
Å Is consistent with the financial statements and does
not contain material misstatements
Å Contains the information as required by Part 9 of
Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code
We have read the other information. Based on our
knowledge and understanding obtained through our
audit of the financial statements or otherwise, we have
considered whether the other information contains
material misstatements. By performing these procedures,
we comply with the requirements of Part 9 of Book 2 of
the Dutch Civil Code and the Dutch Standard 720. The
scope of the procedures performed is substantially less
than the scope of those performed in our audit of the
financial statements.
Management is responsible for the preparation of the
other information, including the executive board’s report in
accordance with Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code
and other information required by Part 9 of Book 2 of the
Dutch Civil Code.
Report on other legal and regulatory requirements
Engagement
We were engaged by the supervisory board as auditor of
ABN AMRO Group N.V. on 11 September 2015, as of the
audit for the year 2016 and have operated as statutory
auditor since that date.
No prohibited non-audit services
We have not provided prohibited non-audit services as
referred to in Article 5(1) of the EU Regulation on specific
requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest
entities, with one exception.
During 2018, an EY tax team in the Netherlands, not
involved in the audit of the financial statements 2018,
conducted a non-audit services engagement at the
request of, and for, a small entity newly acquired by
ABN AMRO. The contractual fee was less than 0.06%
of EY’s audit fees for the consolidated financial statements
2018. As these non-audit services are non-permissible
under the Dutch independence rules, we immediately
terminated this engagement upon identification and
consulted with the audit committee and reported the
incident to the Dutch regulator. Due to the nature and
limited size of the engagement we concluded that our
independence was not compromised, to which the
audit committee agreed with and the Dutch regulator
has not objected.
Description of responsibilities
for the financial statements
Responsibilities of management and the supervisory
board for the financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair
presentation of the financial statements in accordance with
EU-IFRS and Part 9 of Book 2 of the Dutch Civil Code.
Furthermore, management is responsible for such internal
control as management determines is necessary to enable
the preparation of the financial statements that are free
from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
As part of the preparation of the financial statements,
management is responsible for assessing the company’s
ability to continue as a going concern. Based on the
financial reporting frameworks mentioned, management
should prepare the financial statements using the going
concern basis of accounting unless management either
intends to liquidate the company or to cease operations,
or has no realistic alternative but to do so. Management
should disclose events and circumstances that may cast
significant doubt on the company’s ability to continue as
a going concern in the financial statements.
The supervisory board is responsible for overseeing the
company’s financial reporting process.
Our responsibilities for the audit of the financial
statements
Our objective is to plan and perform the audit engagement
in a manner that allows us to obtain sufficient and
appropriate audit evidence for our opinion.
Our audit has been performed with a high, but not
absolute, level of assurance, which means we may not
detect all material errors and fraud during our audit.
Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are
considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,
they could reasonably be expected to influence the
economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these
financial statements. The materiality affects the nature,
timing and extent of our audit procedures and the
evaluation of the effect of identified misstatements
on our opinion.

Other / Independent auditor’s report 263
We have exercised professional judgment and have
maintained professional skepticism throughout the audit,
in accordance with Dutch Standards on Auditing, ethical
requirements and independence requirements. Our audit
included among others:
Å Identifying and assessing the risks of material
misstatement of the financial statements, whether
due to fraud or error, designing and performing audit
procedures responsive to those risks, and obtaining
audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to
provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting
a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher
than for one resulting from error,
Å as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional
omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of
internal control
Å Obtaining an understanding of internal control relevant
to the audit in order to design audit procedures that
are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the
purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness
of the company’s internal control
Å Evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies
used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates
and related disclosures made by management
Å Concluding on the appropriateness of management’s
use of the going concern basis of accounting, and
based on the audit evidence obtained, whether
a material uncertainty exists related to events or
conditions that may cast significant doubt on the
company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Å If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we
are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report
to the related disclosures in the financial statements
or, if such disclosures are inadequate,
Å to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based
on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our
auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions
may cause a company to cease to continue as a going
concern
Å Evaluating the overall presentation, structure and
content of the financial statements, including the
disclosures
Å Evaluating whether the financial statements represent
the underlying transactions and events in a manner that
achieves fair presentation
Because we are ultimately responsible for the opinion,
we are also responsible for directing, supervising and
performing the group audit. In this respect we have
determined the nature and extent of the audit procedures
to be carried out for group entities. Decisive were the size
and/or the risk profile of the group entities or operations.
On this basis, we selected group entities for which an
audit or review had to be carried out on the complete
set of financial information or specific items.
We communicate with the supervisory board regarding,
among other matters, the planned scope and timing of
the audit and significant audit findings, including any
significant findings in internal control that we identify
during our audit. In this respect we also submit an
additional report to the audit committee in accordance
with Article 11 of the EU Regulation on specific
requirements regarding statutory audit of public-interest
entities. The information included in this additional report
is consistent with our audit opinion in this auditor’s report.
We provide the supervisory board with a statement that
we have complied with relevant ethical requirements
regarding independence, and to communicate with them
all relationships and other matters that may reasonably
be thought to bear on our independence, and where
applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the supervisory
board, we determine the key audit matters: those matters
that were of most significance in the audit of the financial
statements. We describe these matters in our auditor’s
report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure
about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances,
not communicating the matter is in the public interest.

Provisions of the Articles of Association concerning
profit appropriation
The provisions regarding the reservation and distribution
of profits are included in Article 10 of the Articles of
Association. In accordance with the reserve and dividend
policy and subject to approval by the Supervisory Board,
the Executive Board proposes to the General Meeting of
Shareholders which part of the profit is to be reserved.
The remainder of the profit will be at the free disposal
of the General Meeting of Shareholders, pursuant to a
proposal to this end by the Executive Board, subject to
approval by the Supervisory Board.
From 2018 onwards, the ABN AMRO dividend payout
policy has been set at 50% of net sustainable profit
attributable to owners of the parent company excluding
exceptional items that significantly distort profitability.
Additional distributions, which can either be special
dividends or share buy-backs (subject to regulatory
approval), will be considered if capital is within or above
the target range and will be subject to other
circumstances, including regulatory and commercial
considerations. The combined distribution will be at least
50% of net sustainable profit. Please refer to the Capital
chapter for more information on ABN AMRO’s dividend
policy.
Fiscal unity
ABN AMRO Group N.V. forms a fiscal unity with several
Dutch subsidiaries for corporate income tax purposes. All
members of the fiscal unity are jointly and severally liable
for the corporate income tax liabilities of the fiscal unity.
Any distribution of dividend remains discretionary, and
deviations from the above policy may be proposed by
ABN AMRO.

Å Adequacy of loss reserves and impairment allowances;
Å Technological changes;
Å Changes in consumer spending, investment and saving

Å Effective capital and liquidity management;
Å The success of ABN AMRO in managing the risks
involved in the foregoing.
